group. Many of you will recognize brian&#39;s name as the author of several Perl
books, including &lt;em&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Effective Perl Programming&lt;/em&gt;. He also
published &lt;em&gt;The Perl Review&lt;/em&gt;. He has consulted and trained in Perl as a
partner at Stonehenge consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he is only in town for a couple of days in the third week of
November we are delaying the meeting by a week. This is a chance to
hear a real expert in Perl speak, and you don&#39;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we always request that you RSVP if you plan to be there, this
time we may be packed. Let us know as soon as possible, if you plan to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we will meet in the lobby at 3131 W. Alabama between 6:40
and 7pm. At which point we will go upstairs to the meeting. If you
arrive later than that, there is a phone in the lobby area that calls
the cPanel tech support team. They can get a message to us to come get
you.&lt;/p&gt;

without a separate compilation step. The standard distribution once had a
program that could compile as Perl script into a standalone executable. In this
talk, Reini Urban describes the Perl compiler and some of the issues with
updating this program to modern Perl versions.</p></div></content><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Perl Compiler&#39; posted.</title><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1110</id><updated>2011-10-24T03:32:27Z</updated><category term="technical meeting"/></entry><entry><published>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</published><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1109Talk/index.html"/><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Brett talked about the Qore programming language. The syntax of the
language has some elements in common with Perl. On the other side, Qore has
some strong support for concurrency as a fundamental feature.</p>

<p>Next, Jake described some work he has done recently for converting ranges
of IP addresses in various forms into a set of IP addresses. This talk was
more low-level than most presentations.</p>

<p>Finally, we had a series of lightning talks that covered several different
topics.</p></div></content><category term="technical meeting"/><updated>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</updated><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1109</id><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Qore Language for Perl Programmers&#39; and &#39;Bit Hacks on IP Ranges&#39; posted.</title></entry><entry><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1108Talk/index.html"/><published>2011-08-15T23:43:24Z</published><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Mark Allen will be presenting the "Intro to Dancer" talk he gave at OSCON 2011.

As usual, the meeting will start at 3131 W. Alabama St. at 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Allen will be presenting the &lt;em&gt;Intro to Dancer&lt;/em&gt; talk he gave at
OSCON 2011. If he has time, Mark has also offered to give a quick
overview of things he learned at OSCON. If you&#39;ve never been to OSCON
and would like to know what it&#39;s like, you should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (probably me) will be in the lobby on the parking level
starting about 6:40pm collecting people. We&#39;ll make our way upstairs to
the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
