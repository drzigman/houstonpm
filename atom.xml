mini-Hack-a-thon.  The idea is to work on Perl projects with other people from
the group. You can work on your own code, an open source project, or help
someone with their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Perl developers with different levels of experience will be on-hand,
this is a great opportunity to get advice or help on everything from design
through coding techniques, documentation ideas, testing suggestion, or most
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the meeting will depend on you. Everyone should bring
their favorite Perl snippets, quick scripts, and one-liners. The only
theme is &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;. If the code solves a problem for you,
it is a subject for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&#39;s her explanation of the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By popular demand, for Houston.pm&#39;s October meeting I will be
presenting some small examples from a bag of tricks useful for taking
on a number of file manipulation tasks, more specifically those suited
to manipulating human readable text.  Such tricks include but are not
limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Quick and easy recursive file operations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Editing files in-place; or, a better alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A blurb on ispell and Lingua::Spelling::Alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some notes on Template::Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Handling errors gracefully in the midst of a large pile of work&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mass renaming of files; good for managing media collections!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides and example code will be made available online after the
meeting.  Each example will be introduced with enough explanation to
help grasp the most important moving pieces.  Plenty of room will be
left over at the end of the presentation for Q&#38;amp;A.  Hopefully the keen
attendee will be able to string these methods together with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sure do hope to see you then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we will meet at 3131 W. Alabama St. The presentation starts
at 7pm. We&#39;ll gather in the lobby on top of the parking garage between
6:40pm and 7pm, and go to the meeting from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Allen will be presenting the &lt;em&gt;Intro to Dancer&lt;/em&gt; talk he gave at
OSCON 2011. If he has time, Mark has also offered to give a quick
overview of things he learned at OSCON. If you&#39;ve never been to OSCON
and would like to know what it&#39;s like, you should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (probably me) will be in the lobby on the parking level
starting about 6:40pm collecting people. We&#39;ll make our way upstairs to
the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
