We will be meeting at our regular location (cPanel) at our regular time (7pm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;brian will talk about Randal Schwartz&#39;s JSON parser regex. This will allow a
good discussion of some of the newer features of Perl&#39;s regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the attendees will be going out for drinks with brian after the
meeting if he feels up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking is free on top of the parking garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hack-a-thon:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;ve got something you are working on and you could use some help, bring it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If you are willing to help someone work on their project come on.&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;/ul&gt;

to join, either to help or to learn is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For July, we will be trying something different. We are having a
mini-Hack-a-thon.  The idea is to work on Perl projects with other people from
the group. You can work on your own code, an open source project, or help
someone with their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Perl developers with different levels of experience will be on-hand,
this is a great opportunity to get advice or help on everything from design
through coding techniques, documentation ideas, testing suggestion, or most
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting will be held at the cPanel offices at 3131 W. Alabama, where
we normally have the technical meetings. We&#39;ll be hacking from around 6 to 9.
Since there&#39;s no presentation, people may be wandering in a different times. If
there is no one in the lobby when you get there, press the button and have
them get in touch with Todd Rinaldo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there. If this works out, we may be able to make this a
semi-regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are concerned with the recent direction of Perl, with Perl 5 holding
back from new features in the name of backwards compatibility, and Perl 6
continuing in a long-term research and development mode. P2 is one of the
attempts to build a Perl 11 (5+6) that combines the best of both.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&#39;s her explanation of the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By popular demand, for Houston.pm&#39;s October meeting I will be
presenting some small examples from a bag of tricks useful for taking
on a number of file manipulation tasks, more specifically those suited
to manipulating human readable text.  Such tricks include but are not
limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Quick and easy recursive file operations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Editing files in-place; or, a better alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A blurb on ispell and Lingua::Spelling::Alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some notes on Template::Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Handling errors gracefully in the midst of a large pile of work&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mass renaming of files; good for managing media collections!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides and example code will be made available online after the
meeting.  Each example will be introduced with enough explanation to
help grasp the most important moving pieces.  Plenty of room will be
left over at the end of the presentation for Q&#38;amp;A.  Hopefully the keen
attendee will be able to string these methods together with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sure do hope to see you then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we will meet at 3131 W. Alabama St. The presentation starts
at 7pm. We&#39;ll gather in the lobby on top of the parking garage between
6:40pm and 7pm, and go to the meeting from there.&lt;/p&gt;

or &#34;the Perl Group&#34; and they&#39;ll point you to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all social meetings, there will be good food, good drink, and
plenty of conversation (on Perl and not). All are welcome, whether
you&#39;ve been to a technical meeting or not. Here is a chance to meet and
chat with other people interested in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a couple of people say that they weren&#39;t sure where the
Black Lab was located. It is on Montrose, just north of Richmond. There
is usually plenty of parking in the back.

books, including &lt;em&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Effective Perl Programming&lt;/em&gt;. He also
published &lt;em&gt;The Perl Review&lt;/em&gt;. He has consulted and trained in Perl as a
partner at Stonehenge consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he is only in town for a couple of days in the third week of
November we are delaying the meeting by a week. This is a chance to
hear a real expert in Perl speak, and you don&#39;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we always request that you RSVP if you plan to be there, this
time we may be packed. Let us know as soon as possible, if you plan to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we will meet in the lobby at 3131 W. Alabama between 6:40
and 7pm. At which point we will go upstairs to the meeting. If you
arrive later than that, there is a phone in the lobby area that calls
the cPanel tech support team. They can get a message to us to come get
you.&lt;/p&gt;
