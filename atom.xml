&lt;p&gt;For July, we will be trying something different. We are having a
mini-Hack-a-thon.  The idea is to work on Perl projects with other people from
the group. You can work on your own code, an open source project, or help
someone with their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Perl developers with different levels of experience will be on-hand,
this is a great opportunity to get advice or help on everything from design
through coding techniques, documentation ideas, testing suggestion, or most
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting will be held at the cPanel offices at 3131 W. Alabama, where
we normally have the technical meetings. We&#39;ll be hacking from around 6 to 9.
Since there&#39;s no presentation, people may be wandering in a different times. If
there is no one in the lobby when you get there, press the button and have
them get in touch with Todd Rinaldo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are concerned with the recent direction of Perl, with Perl 5 holding
back from new features in the name of backwards compatibility, and Perl 6
continuing in a long-term research and development mode. P2 is one of the
attempts to build a Perl 11 (5+6) that combines the best of both.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&#39;s her explanation of the topic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By popular demand, for Houston.pm&#39;s October meeting I will be
presenting some small examples from a bag of tricks useful for taking
on a number of file manipulation tasks, more specifically those suited
to manipulating human readable text.  Such tricks include but are not
limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Quick and easy recursive file operations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Editing files in-place; or, a better alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A blurb on ispell and Lingua::Spelling::Alternative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some notes on Template::Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Handling errors gracefully in the midst of a large pile of work&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mass renaming of files; good for managing media collections!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides and example code will be made available online after the
meeting.  Each example will be introduced with enough explanation to
help grasp the most important moving pieces.  Plenty of room will be
left over at the end of the presentation for Q&#38;amp;A.  Hopefully the keen
attendee will be able to string these methods together with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sure do hope to see you then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we will meet at 3131 W. Alabama St. The presentation starts
at 7pm. We&#39;ll gather in the lobby on top of the parking garage between
6:40pm and 7pm, and go to the meeting from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Effective Perl Programming&lt;/em&gt;. He also
published &lt;em&gt;The Perl Review&lt;/em&gt;. He has consulted and trained in Perl as a
partner at Stonehenge consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

November we are delaying the meeting by a week. This is a chance to
hear a real expert in Perl speak, and you don&#39;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we always request that you RSVP if you plan to be there, this
time we may be packed. Let us know as soon as possible, if you plan to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we will meet in the lobby at 3131 W. Alabama between 6:40
and 7pm. At which point we will go upstairs to the meeting. If you
arrive later than that, there is a phone in the lobby area that calls
the cPanel tech support team. They can get a message to us to come get
you.&lt;/p&gt;

without a separate compilation step. The standard distribution once had a
program that could compile as Perl script into a standalone executable. In this
talk, Reini Urban describes the Perl compiler and some of the issues with
updating this program to modern Perl versions.</p></div></content><category term="technical meeting"/><updated>2011-10-24T03:32:27Z</updated><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1110</id><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Perl Compiler&#39; posted.</title></entry><entry><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1109Talk/index.html"/><published>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</published><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Brett talked about the Qore programming language. The syntax of the
language has some elements in common with Perl. On the other side, Qore has
some strong support for concurrency as a fundamental feature.</p>

<p>Next, Jake described some work he has done recently for converting ranges
of IP addresses in various forms into a set of IP addresses. This talk was
more low-level than most presentations.</p>

<p>Finally, we had a series of lightning talks that covered several different
topics.</p></div></content><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Qore Language for Perl Programmers&#39; and &#39;Bit Hacks on IP Ranges&#39; posted.</title><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1109</id><updated>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</updated><category term="technical meeting"/></entry><entry><published>2011-08-15T23:43:24Z</published><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1108Talk/index.html"/><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Mark Allen will be presenting the "Intro to Dancer" talk he gave at OSCON 2011.

As usual, the meeting will start at 3131 W. Alabama St. at 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Allen will be presenting the &lt;em&gt;Intro to Dancer&lt;/em&gt; talk he gave at
OSCON 2011. If he has time, Mark has also offered to give a quick
overview of things he learned at OSCON. If you&#39;ve never been to OSCON
and would like to know what it&#39;s like, you should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (probably me) will be in the lobby on the parking level
starting about 6:40pm collecting people. We&#39;ll make our way upstairs to
the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
