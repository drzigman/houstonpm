monthly meeting. First, we are going to be meeting on a different day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, January 28 at cPanel (2550 North Loop West, Suite 4006,
  Houston, Texas 77092).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll also be holding the meeting at a different time. The meeting will
start an hour earlier, at 6pm. So meet in the lobby between 5:30 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, Nicolas Rochelemagne will present some of what he has
learned over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you all there, in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

which is the boring part of the game you have to do (or pay to bypass) in
order to get stronger.  In fact, this is the entire freemium business model
and I&#39;m willing to bet you have more then a few of these games installed on
your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could figure out what the game was doing with
each of these taps and automate it?  Why stop there, you could create your
own army and dominate the virtual landscape finally putting that college
education to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us as we walk through just this process for a very popular mobile game
that shall remain nameless (because I like the game and don&#39;t want to get
banned!) but all shall be revealed at our next meeting.  There will be a
real-time walk through of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demo of the Game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decompiling the app using JADX and JetBrains.dotPeek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reverse engineering the API the game uses by way of BlueStacks, Charles,
and ProxyCap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a WebSocket client ( using Moo as a change of pace from Moose )
to simulate what the app does, automating the boring grind-y parts of the
game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time permits a discussion on Moo versus Moose thoughts will be
provided.  Bring your mobile phones and your perlbrew, for we shall tear
those meddling do-gooders asunder.  Mwwwwwwhahahahaa!&lt;/p&gt;

compiler project at cPanel. He began with some of the pre-requisites needed to
understand the presentation, including a basic understanding of C:

<ul>
    <li>structures</li>
    <li>unions</li>
    <li>arrays</li>
    <li>typedefs</li>
    <li>#define</li>
</ul>

He showed Nicolas Rochelemagne's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNsew4U-quM"
target="blank">Introduction to Perl Internals</a> to give some background. Nicolas
covered some of the basics of Perl internal data structures and some information
about how perl handles memory.

After the video, Todd explained the <code>B::C</code> module and some of its
siblings.  He explained the difference between a stash and a pad, and talked
about how new pads are added each time you add a scope. Todd spent a little
more time discussing the internal data structures, mostly focusing on how they
relate to stashes and pads.

Next, he discussed how the parser doesn't actually generate an op-tree, as you might
guess from an study of compilers. Instead, it generates several op-trees, that are
linked together by entries in the stashes. He recommended spending time studying
Reini Urban's <a href="https://github.com/rurban/illguts" target="_blank">Ill Guts</a>
if you are going to spend any time understanding this stuff.

He spent some time discussing some of what cPanel is using the compiler for and what
they hoped to accomplish. He discussed some ideas about optimizing op-trees.

The talk generated several interesting discussions, that branched off the main topic
at times.</p></div></content><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2017talks/1707Talk/index.html"/><published>2017-07-30T05:00:17Z</published><title type="html">Notes for &#39;Getting gutsy with perl5&#39; posted.</title><category term="technical meeting"/><updated>2017-07-30T05:00:17Z</updated><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1707</id></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Rinaldo wikk dive into the basics of how Perl data structures work under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
