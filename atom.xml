&lt;p&gt;As usual, we will meet at the Black Labrador around 7pm. Ask for &#34;Wade&#34;
or &#34;the Perl Group&#34; and they&#39;ll point you to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all social meetings, there will be good food, good drink, and
plenty of conversation (on Perl and not). All are welcome, whether
you&#39;ve been to a technical meeting or not. Here is a chance to meet and
chat with other people interested in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a couple of people say that they weren&#39;t sure where the
Black Lab was located. It is on Montrose, just north of Richmond. There
is usually plenty of parking in the back.
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Black+Labrador,+Houston,+TX&#38;amp;hl=en&#38;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#38;amp;sspn=56.112526,92.021484&#38;amp;vpsrc=0&#38;amp;hq=The+Black+Labrador,+Houston,+TX&#38;amp;t=m&#38;amp;z=15&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

group. Many of you will recognize brian&#39;s name as the author of several Perl
books, including &lt;em&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Effective Perl Programming&lt;/em&gt;. He also
published &lt;em&gt;The Perl Review&lt;/em&gt;. He has consulted and trained in Perl as a
partner at Stonehenge consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he is only in town for a couple of days in the third week of
November we are delaying the meeting by a week. This is a chance to
hear a real expert in Perl speak, and you don&#39;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we always request that you RSVP if you plan to be there, this
time we may be packed. Let us know as soon as possible, if you plan to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we will meet in the lobby at 3131 W. Alabama between 6:40
and 7pm. At which point we will go upstairs to the meeting. If you
arrive later than that, there is a phone in the lobby area that calls
the cPanel tech support team. They can get a message to us to come get
you.&lt;/p&gt;
