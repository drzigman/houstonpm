without a separate compilation step. The standard distribution once had a
program that could compile as Perl script into a standalone executable. In this
talk, Reini Urban describes the Perl compiler and some of the issues with
updating this program to modern Perl versions.</p></div></content><category term="technical meeting"/><updated>2011-10-24T03:32:27Z</updated><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1110</id><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Perl Compiler&#39; posted.</title></entry><entry><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1109Talk/index.html"/><published>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</published><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Brett talked about the Qore programming language. The syntax of the
language has some elements in common with Perl. On the other side, Qore has
some strong support for concurrency as a fundamental feature.</p>

<p>Next, Jake described some work he has done recently for converting ranges
of IP addresses in various forms into a set of IP addresses. This talk was
more low-level than most presentations.</p>

<p>Finally, we had a series of lightning talks that covered several different
topics.</p></div></content><title type="html">Notes for &#39;The Qore Language for Perl Programmers&#39; and &#39;Bit Hacks on IP Ranges&#39; posted.</title><id>tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1109</id><updated>2011-10-24T00:03:02Z</updated><category term="technical meeting"/></entry><entry><published>2011-08-15T23:43:24Z</published><link href="http://houston.pm.org/talks/2011talks/1108Talk/index.html"/><content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Mark Allen will be presenting the "Intro to Dancer" talk he gave at OSCON 2011.

As usual, the meeting will start at 3131 W. Alabama St. at 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Allen will be presenting the &lt;em&gt;Intro to Dancer&lt;/em&gt; talk he gave at
OSCON 2011. If he has time, Mark has also offered to give a quick
overview of things he learned at OSCON. If you&#39;ve never been to OSCON
and would like to know what it&#39;s like, you should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (probably me) will be in the lobby on the parking level
starting about 6:40pm collecting people. We&#39;ll make our way upstairs to
the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
