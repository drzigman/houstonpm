<h1>Vim for Perl Development</h1>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What Is Vim?</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Vi Improved</li>
<li>That old, weird modal editor</li>
<li>Ubiquitous</li>
<li>Modern, powerful programming editor</li>
<li>All of the above</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Editor, not Writer</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Vim is not a text-entry system.</li>
<li>Vim is an <em>editor</em>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>We normally think that most of our time in the editor is spent writing.
In actually, we spend more time changing old text than writing new text.
For Vim, adding text is a subset of the functionality of the editor. Vim has
extensive capabilities for editing.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Vim is Modal</h1>
<ul>
<li>Normal mode</li>
<li>Insert/Replace mode</li>
<li>Visual mode</li>
<li>CmdLine mode</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Only one of the four modes is directly related to entering text. The other
thre are related to navigation and editing of text.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Navigation Commands</h1>
<ul>
<li>Simple: h j k l 0 ^ $ - +</li>
<li>More Complex: gg G C-f C-b L M H zt zz zb</li>
<li>Text Object: w W b B e E ( ) { } [[ ]] %</li>
<li>Search: t f T F , ; * # n N</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>One of the hardest things for people to learn with VI or Vim is that
the navigation commands are done with normal keys rather than with special
navigation keys. This turns out to be very efficient for touch typists. You
can navigate without taking your hands far from the home keys.</p>
<p>In addition, Vim's navigation commands are much richer than those in most
editors. Instead of pounding on (or holding down) an arrow key, you can
often move to almost exactly the right place with a few keystrokes.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Repeated Movement</h1>
<ul>
<li>10j - move down ten lines</li>
<li>3f) - move to the third <code>)</code> to the right</li>
<li>5W - move 5 groups of non-whitespace characters to the right</li>
<li>3C-b - move 3 pages up</li>
<li>235gg - move to line 235</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Most of movement commands can be preceeded by a count which applies the
same command multiple times.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Editing Commands</h1>
<ul>
<li>Edit commands: c d y p P &lt; &gt; g~ gu gU gq</li>
<li>Must be followed by a motion command</li>
<li>Single character edits: x r ~ s J</li>
<li>Line edits: cc dd yy &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</li>
<li>End of line edits: C D
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The first set of commands perform the following actions when followed by a
motion command: change, delete, yank, paste after, paste before, outdent,
indent, toggle case, lowercase, uppercase, and justify. The &lt;, &gt;, and
gq commands need a line motion, the others expect a character motion.</p>

<p>The single character edits do not require a motion command but can be
preceeded by a count to affect that many characters: delete, replace,
toggle case, change, and join next line with this one.</p>

<p>Line edits affect the entire line. Adding a count, affects that many lines.
The <em>end of line</em> variants edit from the current position to the end
of the line.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Registers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Unnamed register "</li>
<li>Numbered registers 0-9</li>
<li>Named registers a-z A-Z</li>
<li>Clipboard: +</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>One really under-appreciated concept in Vim concerns the registers. When
cutting, copying, and pasting, Vim does not just use one clipboard. Instead,
the program supports a number of registers. Anytime a yank, delete, or change
is executed, the data goes into the unnamed register (and register 0), unless
you specify a particular named register. Each time one of those commands is
executed, the previous value of the 0 register is moved to the 1 register.
This is repeated for each numbered register, up to register 9.</p>

<p>If you want to hold onto a piece of text for longer than one cut/paste,
you can use one of the 26 named registers, by prefixing the command with
<em>"</em> and the letter naming the register. So, <em>"byy</em> yanks the
current line into register b. Using an uppercase letter, appends to that
register rather than just replacing. If you use name a register before the
p or P command, it pastes the data from that register instead.</p>

<p>One other special register is <em>+</em>. This register is mapped to the
system clipboard. This feature allows easily moving data to and from other
programs.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Insert Mode</h1>
<ul>
<li>Motion commands: c C s S R</li>
<li>Insert: i I</li>
<li>Append: a A</li>
<li>New Line: o O</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>There are a number of ways to enter insert mode. Vim novices pick one,
use it to get into insert mode and spend most of their time entering text.
As you become more familiar with the different ways to enter insert mode,
you find that using the correct command can save you typing. For example,
<em>a</em> starts appending after the current character, but <em>A</em> appends
to the end of the line. This saves you from cursoring to the end of the line
(or <em>$</em>, if you are more Vim-savvy). Likewise, <em>I</em> inserts
before the first non-whitespace character on the line. The commands <em>o</em>
and <em>O</em> inserts a new line after/before the current line, moves there,
and enters insert mode.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Visual Mode</h1>
<ul>
<li>Character selection: v</li>
<li>Line selection: V</li>
<li>Block selection: C-v</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Visual mode could also be called selection mode. Any motion commands after
entering visual mode extends the selection. The way the selection extends is
determined by how visual mode was entered. Using a command such as y, c, or
d applies to the entire selection. This selection can also specify the range
affected by one of the colon commands, like substitute.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>CmdLine Mode</h1>
<ul>
<li>File/Buffer commands: :w :e :r :n :N :q :find</li>
<li>Edit commands: :s/// :co :m :d :c</li>
<li>Search commands: / ?</li>
<li>Filter commands: !
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The first group of commands has to do with writing a buffer, editing a
new file, reading a file into the current buffer, moving to the next/previous
file from the commands line, quitting the current buffer, and find a file
from the path and edit it.</p>

<p>The substitute command is your <em>search and replace</em> command. It
supports regular expressions. The other commands of this group can often be
done more easily with normal mode commands: copy, move, delete, and change.
One place where these can be particularly useful is where the range can be
determined by a search.</p>

<p>The search commands use regular expressions to find text. The n and N
commands are used to move to the next match.</p>

<p>The filter command is possibly the most powerful. The selected text or
the specified range is supplied as standard input to the specified command.
The output from the command then replaces the selection. This allows any
filter-type command on the system to be used to modify text in the editor,
without leaving the editor.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Text Objects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Inner or Outer: i or a</li>
<li>Object: w W s p</li>
<li>Matching: [ ] ( ) b { } B &lt; &gt; t</li>
<li>Quoted strings: " ' `</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>In many cases, commands that take a motion can take a text object instead.
This allows some pretty powerful edits to be accomplished with a few keystrokes.
Unfortunately, constructing the text object requires a small amount of getting
used to. The text object starts with wither <em>i</em> or <em>a</em>. This
makes it either an <em>inner</em> text object (without the delimiters) or
<em>all</em> (with the delimiters). In the case of the first set of object,
the difference is the surrounding whitespace. For the other text objects,
<em>i</em> means without the delimiters and <em>a</em> includes the delimiters.</p>

<p>The first set of object characters specifies words, non-whitespace characters,
sentences, and paragraphs. The matching sets define a text object delimited
by the specified pairs of characters. You only need to specify one of them.
The <em>b</em> character is a synonym for the parentheses. The <em>B</em>
character is a synonym for the curly braces. The <em>t</em> character refers
to XML or HTML tags. So <em>it</em> refers to the text object delimited by
the nearest enclosing tags.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Repeated Edits</h1>
<ul>
<li>Repeat last edit: .</li>
<li>Recorded macros: q @</li>
<li>vim script</li>
<li><em>perldo</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>There's been a lot of talk so far about edits in Vim being different than
just typing text. Now we can see why that is important. The <em>.</em> command
repeats the last edit in the current cursor location. That could be as simple
an edit as deleting a character (<em>x</em>) or word (<em>dw</em>). Or it could
be more complicated like indent the enclosing code block (<em>&lt;iB</em>).</p>

<p>The problem with the <em>.</em> command is that it is just one edit. Once
you begin a motion, the edit is considered completed. A macro can include any
form of change that you can perofm in Vim. Press <em>q</em> followed by a
register name and then perform the edits and motions you need. Finish the
macro with another <em>q</em>. You execute the macro by typing <em>@</em>
followed by the macro name. When using recorded macros, the more advanced
motion commands are more useful. Your edit can apply to different amounts of
text as long as it follows the same structure.</p>

<p>The next feature is vim script, which is a full programming language.
Using vim script, you can add new functionality to the editor. We'll discuss
this more later.</p>

<p>For Perl programmers, one of the most powerful features is <em>perldo</em>
which allows you to execute a perl command on selected portions of your text.
This feature is only availabale if Perl support was compiled in to your
installation of Vim.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Word Completion</h1>
<ul>
<li>Complete words: C-n C-p C-xC-i</li>
<li>Stop completion: C-xC-e</li>
<li>Specific: C-xC-d C-xC-] C-xC-f</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Some languages are very verbose and require editor support to help
remember the names of all of the methods and variables you might want to use.
Vim provides a relatively simple version of this feature with word
completion.</p>

<p>The first two list all of the keywords from the current file that match the
text typed so far. The <em>C-xC-i</em> also applies keywords from files that
are included. If you've decided you'd rather finish typing rather than select
from the list, use <em>C-xC-e</em>. There are also some special purpose
completions for definitions or macros, entries in the <code>tags</code> file
and filenames found on the path.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Window Support</h1>
<ul>
<li>Window support: :sp (C-w s) :vs (C-w s)</li>
<li>Close windows: :q :qall :on</li>
<li>Navigating: C-w j C-w k C-w h C-w l</li>
<li>Automation: :windo</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Vim supports working with multiple windows at one time. You can have the
Same file in multiple windows. This is more useful in the gui version of the
vim.</p>

<p>An unusual command is <em>:windo</em> which applies a command to the files
in every open window.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Tab Support</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create: :tabe[dit] :tabnew :tabf[ind] C-w gf</li>
<li>Closing: :tabc[lose] :tabo[nly]</li>
<li>Navigation: :tabn :tabN :tabr[ewind] :tabfir[st] :tabl[ast]</li>
<li>Automation: :tabdo</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Tabbed interfaces are pretty popular laterly. Of course, vim supports tabs
as well. First you have to be able to open tabs, you can do that using the
<code>-p</code> command line option when starting vim. But, it's more useful
to create tabs as you need them. The first set of commands opens a file for
editing in a new tab, creates an empty tab, finds a file on the path and opens
it in a new tab, and opens the filename under the cursor in a new tab.</p>

<p>You can close a tab with <em>:tabc</em>. You can close all but the current
tab with <em>:tabo</em>. Navigation is performed with the next set of
commands. These move to the next, previous, first (2 ways), and last open
tab.</p>

<p>Finally, tabs also support automation through the <em>:tabdo</em> command
which applies a supplied command to all of the open tabs.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Customizing Vim</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="_vimrc">.vimrc</a></li>
<li>.vim directory</li>
<li>vim script</li>
<li>syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The <code>~/.vimrc</code> file is loaded when vim starts. This file usually
contains configuration commands that customize the editor.</p>

<p>The <code>~/.vim</code> directory contains a number of directories and
files that further customize vim. This is normally where script and doc
files are added.</p>

<p>Vim has its own scripting langauge. Much of the customization of vim is
accomplished using this scripting language. The vim site contains a large
number of scripts written by programmers to add more functionality to vim.</p>

<p>In fact, even vim's syntax highlighting is implemented using this
scripting language. The current syntax highlighting system supports around the
dyntax for around 480 different languages.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Useful Scripts</h1>
<ul>
<li>DirDiff.vim</li>
<li>surround.vim</li>
<li>vimballPlugin.vim</li>
<li>snippetsEmu.vim</li>
<li>NERD_commenter.vim</li>
<li>taglist.vim</li>
<li>vcscommand.vim</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>These are a few scripts that I found extremely useful. <code>DirDiff</code>
allows comparison of two directory trees and the files in them.
<code>surround</code> supports editing characters that surround other text.
This includes quotes and matching pairs like parens, and braces. The
<code>vimballPlugin</code> script supports a mechanism for packaging and
installing other scripts. <code>scriptsEmu</code> provides a system for
TextMate code snippets. The <code>NERD_commenter</code> script handles
commenting and uncommenting large sections of code all at once. The
<code>taglist</code> script give vim the ability to make a kind of menu
from the file created by the tags program. <code>vcscommand</code> provides
functionality to access several different types of version control systems,
including SVN, CVS, and git.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Perl-Specific Customizations</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>gf</code> with changes to include, includeexpr, isfname</li>
<li><code>make</code> support</li>
<li>Use <code>ack</code> instead of grep external files.</li>
<li>Mapped commands for perltidy, perlcritic, perldoc, prove, etc.</li>
<li>Special templates for new files.</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The normal vim support for Perl includes some useful customizations.
The <em>gf</em> command opens the file under the cursor. With a few
customizations, vim recognizes Perl <code>use</code> statements and converts
the module name into a filename to open.</p>

<p>With a couple more customizations, we can repurpose vim's built-in make
support to give a quick compile check for Perl code. Similarly, vim uses
grep to search external files, but we can customize it to use <code>ack</code>
instead.</p>

<p>By mapping commands with special keystrokes, we can add functinality.
Examples include the ability to run perltidy or perlcritic on code. Vim already
supports a keyword-lookup help feature, with a few minor tweaks, it uses 
perldoc.</p>

<p>Many programming languages need a fair amount of boilerplate to get
started. Perl doesn't require much, but we can benefit by starting our files
the same way every time. Using the <code>autocmd</code> feature, we can
cause vim to read a template any time a new file of a particular type is
created.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Perl Custom Commands</h1>
<ul>
<li>My customizations: <a href="perl_local.vim">perl_local.vim</a></li>
<li><em>,pt</em> for perltidy</li>
<li><em>,pc</em> for perlcritic</li>
<li><em>,pD</em> to deparse code</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>In the customization file, I've added <code>maps</code> for the listed
strings to commands I might want to run on code. The <em>,pt</em> for running
<code>perltidy</code> and <em>,pc</em> for running <code>perlcritic</code>
have pretty obvious utility. <em>,pD</em> is a bit different. It compiles the
selected Perl code and then decompiles it to show Perl's interpretation of
the code. This can be used to de-obfuscate code that came from someone else.</p>
