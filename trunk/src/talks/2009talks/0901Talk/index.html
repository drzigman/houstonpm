    <h2 class="subhead">Programming Editors for Perl</h2>

    <h3 class="subsub">Emacs</h3>

    <p>Robert Boone started the presentation with an exploration of the
      emacs editor, focusing on features of use to Perl programmers. His
      <a href="notes.html">presentation</a> was generated from emacs
      <em>org mode</em>.</p>

    <p>Phil King followed with a lightning talk showing how to use
      <code>perldb</code> from emacs as a kind of built-in debugger.
      (Launched with <code>M-x perldb</code>.)</p>

    <h3 class="subsub">Eclipse/EPIC</h3>

    <p>Todd Rinaldo was next, presenting a set of editors he uses for
       different purposes.</p>

    <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.notetab.com/">NoteTab</a> for simple text entry and powerful search
         and replace.</li>
       <li>The <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</a> is
         a fast, basic editor with syntax highlighting.</li>
       <li>The <a href="http://www.epic-ide.org/">EPIC</a> IDE built on the
         <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> platform is his main
         editor.</li>
       <li>The comercial version of <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/Komodo">Komodo</a>
         supports a very good regular expression debugging tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Todd mostly focused on the features of EPIC. Since it's built on the
      Eclipse platform, it has a built-in update mechanism that makes adding
      and updating features quite easy. It's Java-based, which means it should
      run anywhere the JVM is available. The editor has Subversion integration
      and the ability to edit remotely through FTP.</p>

    <p>EPIC has full syntax highlighting for Perl as well as the ability
      to syntax check the code on save. Support for both <code>Perl::Critic</code>
      and <code>Perl::Tidy</code> is built in.</p>

    <p>There are a few issues, however. Changing the colors in Eclipse can be
      annoying, because those options are determined by multiple subsystems.
      This can sometimes make it hard to find which option on which menu
      affects which color. Todd says it can run a telnet session, but SSH
      does not appear to work properly. The FTP-based access can sometimes
      become confused, especially when network problems occur. Obviously, the
      syntax check can fail when working remotely if the local environment
      does not match.</p>

    <h3 class="subsub">Vim</h3>

    <p>G. Wade Johnson finished the session with an <a
      href="vim_for_perl.html">overview</a> of vim. Most of the presentation
      covered non-Perl-specific features of the editor. One point that he
      repeated several times was that vim is optimized for <em>editing text</em>,
      as opposed to <em>entering text</em>.</p>
      
    <p>He did show some Perl-specific customizations and functionality at
      the end of the presentation. The presentation above is an S5 slideshow.
      The full notes are available by printing the slides or from the menu
      in the lower right of the page.</p>

    <h3 class="subsub">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Considering the <em>holy wars</em> that often result when programmers
       talk editors, this meeting was surprisingly non-violent. No blood was
       shed and no voices were raised in anger. Everyone seemed to learn a
       bit from each presentation, whether on their editor of choice or not.</p>
