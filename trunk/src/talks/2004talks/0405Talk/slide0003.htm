<P>
CGI is a script that creates a fill-out form and echoes back its values.
</P>


<P>
This is the most important module to know about if you're programming websites. It has much more capability than we can talk about here.
</P>


<P>
This perl library uses perl5 objects to make it easy to create Web fill-out forms and parse their contents.  This package defines CGI objects, entities that contain the values of the current query string and other state variables.  Using a CGI object's methods, you can examine keywords and parameters passed to your script, and create forms whose initial values are taken from the current query (thereby preserving state information).  The module provides shortcut functions that produce boilerplate HTML, reducing typing and coding errors. It also provides functionality for some of the more advanced features of CGI scripting, including support for file uploads, cookies, cascading style sheets, server push, and frames.
</P>


<P>
CGI.pm also provides a simple function-oriented programming style for those who don't need its object-oriented features.
