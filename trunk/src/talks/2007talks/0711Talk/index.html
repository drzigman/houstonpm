    <h2 class="subhead">Barely Used Perl</h2>

    <p>Robert Boone presented 3 <em>barely used</em> features from the Perl
    core modules. Robert's company heavily uses perl. Their customers
    often have the problem of not having the exact Perl modules expected
    when trying to use Robert's company's code. Therefore, they are taking
    the approach of preferring modules that come with the Perl distribution,
    thus assuring that the customer has the modules out of the box.</p>

    <p>The first module was <code>NEXT</code>, which is a Perl builtin module
    to provide proper inheritance calling for complex object structures.</p>

    <p>The second topic was a module called <code>overload</code>, which
    allows you to change the behaviour of operators (+, -, ., etc.) so that
    you can do cool object things like adding 4 to an object and have it
    have meaning. This allows your code to be a lot more intuitive.</p> 

    <p>The third topic was <code>Attribute::Handlers</code>. An overly
    simplistic explanation of this complex topic is that it will allow your
    subroutines to behave differently based on what they should return. It
    also provides support for better inheritance handling.</p>

    <p>We also re-hashed briefly some issues I had after Wade's talk on
    anonymous code references (<a href="/talks/2007talks/0709Talk/index.html">September
    2007</a>). Todd was attempting to use anonymous code creation when inside
    an object. We were able to work through the issues ending with a sub in
    an object that creates references to subroutines in the scope of the object
    (phew!).</p>

    <p>(Thanks to Todd Rinaldo for the summary this month.)</p>
