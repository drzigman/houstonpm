    <p>For the April meeting, Wade Johnson lead the first in a two-part
      discussion entitled <em>What Every Perl Programmer Should Know: tips,
      tricks, and common knowledge</em>. The idea from the presentation came
      from a book for another language I read called <cite>C++ Common
      Knowledge</cite>. That book got started a chain of thought about what we
      as Perl programmers should all know.</p>

    <p>This presentation was very different from many of the others because of
      a change in presentation technology and focus. I wanted this to be more
      of a discussion than a lecture. The PerlPoint presentations used in the
      past have the same problem as their PowerPoint equivalents, linear
      presentation style. This form of presentation does not lend itself to
      discussion and almost discourages tangential topics.</p>

    <p>Instead, I used <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> to
      store the material I wanted to cover. I also added more content than I
      expected to cover to allow tailoring the discussion to junior or more
      senior Perl programmers, depending on who was there.</p>

    <p>As the discussion progressed, we ended up adding examples and more
      content to the wiki. The result was a much more interactive session and
      better content than I started with. The resulting presentation is
      available on the <a href="tiddlywiki_weppsk.html">attached page</a>.</p>
      
    <p>There are a few things that may not be obvious on viewing this Wiki. The
      left hand menu is a list of topics I had planned to cover. Underneath that
      are links to lists of topics covered by the named tags. The <em>apr</em>
      tag lists all of the pages we covered at the April meeting. The right-hand
      side contains admin functions and a set of tabs that give other
      organization of the content. Finally, if you use the <em>save link as</em>
      feature of your browser on the link above, you will get a single HTML page
      that contains the entire presentation. When opened as a file in the
      browser, the wiki is editable.</p>

    <p>Near the end of the meeting we decided to do one more meeting next month
      on this topic to see if we can get more of the information covered.</p>
