<P>
This session is intended to show a 'jumpstart' script into learning Perl.  The goal is not to try to teach Perl programming in one session or with one script, but to try to give an entry point into learning Perl with a script that should also prove useful as you continue your learning process.
</P>


<P>
The script presented here is designed to facilitate searching through the sections of Perl's FAQ's for questions (and answers) relating to a keyword or phrase you supply on the command-line. The script is not long (less than 40 lines of actual code) but it does demonstrate some common structures and commands used in processing text files.
