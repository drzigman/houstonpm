<P>
There's a great deal more to this module than we've been able to cover in this short article. The module's documentation is in the neighborhood of 1,500 lines.
</P>


<P>
For example, there are many more directives available, options can be clustered, and you can use the module to parse config files rather than the command line if you like.
</P>


<P>
Although it seems complex (and it is underneath) the documentation is well written and it's not very hard to get started with this module and well worth the effort to learn what it can do. Working through the actual module code itself can also be a great learning exercise for those who have the stomach for it.
