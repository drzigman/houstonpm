<P>
Now, you might think the problem was simply being too restrictive in our second pattern.  Maybe it should have been: /:\*(.*)$/.  But, the real problem was not checking if the pattern actually succeeded before we tried to use the results of the match.  And, we have the same problem with our part number extraction as well (it just didn't cause any problems this time).  Always check any operation that later code depends on.
