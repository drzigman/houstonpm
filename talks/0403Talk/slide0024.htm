<P>
Finally, the -f option. In this case, the argument specification is followed by three trailing dots. This means the option expects a list of one or more arguments, and the variable they will be stored in for the action block will an array (@INFILE). We also have a [required] directive in the description. Our action block includes a new feature though: the &quot;defer&quot; keyword. This keyword takes a block as an argument and it means that the action will not be executed until the entire command line has been successfully parsed (non-deferred actions are executed as soon as they are found on the command line).
