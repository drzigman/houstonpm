When\nI started working with Dancer2, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit last fall,\nI'd seen the basics, but I found out /very/ quickly that there's much more to\nlearn. The capabilities of this stack can influence application design from the\nground upâdatabase tables, all the way to the final frameworks you might choose\nto use on the frontend, and not all of those repercussions are immediately\nclear from merely reading the documentation!</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we'll learn about some of the strengths of these modules and\ndemonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work faster and\nwrite great web-based applications.</p>\n</div>",
