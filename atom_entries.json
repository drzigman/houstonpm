Nicolas\ncovered some of the basics of Perl internal data structures and some information\nabout how perl handles memory.\n\nAfter the video, Todd explained the <code>B::C</code> module and some of its\nsiblings.  He explained the difference between a stash and a pad, and talked\nabout how new pads are added each time you add a scope. Todd spent a little\nmore time discussing the internal data structures, mostly focusing on how they\nrelate to stashes and pads.\n\nNext, he discussed how the parser doesn't actually generate an op-tree, as you might\nguess from an study of compilers. Instead, it generates several op-trees, that are\nlinked together by entries in the stashes. He recommended spending time studying\nReini Urban's <a href=\"https://github.com/rurban/illguts\" target=\"_blank\">Ill Guts</a>\nif you are going to spend any time understanding this stuff.\n\nHe spent some time discussing some of what cPanel is using the compiler for and what\nthey hoped to accomplish.
