Nicolas\ncovered some of the basics of Perl internal data structures and some information\nabout how perl handles memory.\n\nAfter the video, Todd explained the <code>B::C</code> module and some of its\nsiblings.  He explained the difference between a stash and a pad, and talked\nabout how new pads are added each time you add a scope. Todd spent a little\nmore time discussing the internal data structures, mostly focusing on how they\nrelate to stashes and pads.\n\nNext, he discussed how the parser doesn't actually generate an op-tree, as you might\nguess from an study of compilers. Instead, it generates several op-trees, that are\nlinked together by entries in the stashes. He recommended spending time studying\nReini Urban's <a href=\"https://github.com/rurban/illguts\" target=\"_blank\">Ill Guts</a>\nif you are going to spend any time understanding this stuff.\n\nHe spent some time discussing some of what cPanel is using the compiler for and what\nthey hoped to accomplish. He discussed some ideas about optimizing op-trees.\n\nThe talk generated several interesting discussions, that branched off the main topic\nat times.</p>"},"published":"2017-07-30T05:00:17Z","updated":"2017-07-30T05:00:17Z","id":"tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1707","category":"technical meeting","link":"http://houston.pm.org/talks/2017talks/1707Talk/index.html","title":"Notes for 'Getting gutsy with perl5' posted."},{"id":"tag:houston.pm.org.2011-03:announce-20170706-23755","updated":"2017-07-06T21:24:26Z","published":"2017-07-06T21:24:26Z","content":"<div><p>Todd Rinaldo wikk dive into the basics of how Perl data structures work under the hood.</p>\n</div>","title":"Getting gutsy with perl5"},{"category":"technical meeting","updated":"2017-07-06T04:34:04Z","id":"tag:houston.pm.org,2011-03:presentation:1706","published":"2017-07-06T04:34:04Z","content":{"type":"xhtml","content":"<p>JD Lightsey suggested that the group make an attempt at the Perl Programming\nchallenge that OC.pm proposed for their May 2017 meeting.
