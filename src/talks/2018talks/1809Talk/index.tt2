      <h2 class="subhead">Performance of Parsing Short Strings</h2>

      <p>G. Wade Johnson has a 3D Printing hobby. For the beginning of the talk he introduced the
main stages of going from a design to a 3D printed object. The result of one stage (slicing)
is a Gcode file, which is basically a set of commands for controlling the movement of the
print head, the temperatures, and the extrusion of the plastic.</p>
      <p>He explained that the format is pretty simple. People have written code to modify the Gcode
file before printing to generate interesting effects or fix problems with the code. He has
written special purpose tools like this a few times. But, he wanted to create a more general
tool. Modifying a Gcode file pretty much boils down to recognizing lines in the file, and then
changing them, adding new lines, or removing lines.</p>
      <p>After building some initial code using regular expressions to do the matching, he began to
wonder about other approaches. You will sometimes hear people argue that a purpose-built
piece of code can beat a regular expression in some cases. There are also different ways that
you can <em>optimize</em> a regular expression to get potentially quicker results. He decided
to test some of those ideas.</p>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>

      <p>When doing benchmarking on code, it is important to understand what you are actually measuring
and to eliminate variables that might confound your findings. So, he started with the constants
in the tests.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The full Gcode file was loaded into memory and accessed as an array of lines. This removes
        variability in time spent reading the file from disk from the actual tests.</li>
        <li>These are real Gcode files, so some of the lines will match and some will not. This tests
        both modes of the matching.</li>
        <li>Different test scripts matched a different number of times, and some of them extracted
        data, while some did not.</li>
        <li>Different test files executed different types of matching code. The regexes work pretty much
        the same no matter what, but different optimizations apply if you are looking for an exact match
        vs. a partial match vs. attempting to extract values from the string.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>The Tests</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/gwadej/gcode-parse_speed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a>
for the test code is available on github.</p>
      <p>The four tests are described in the README under the heading SCRIPTS. The short description of the
tests is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>bm-zero_extruder: Simple match, large number of positives</li>
        <li>bm-zmove: More complicated match, large number of positives</li>
        <li>bm-double_zmove: match in two places in data, two stage match</li>
        <li>bm-G1: match 3-5 times with somewhat simple match</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/gwadej/gcode-parse_speed/tree/master/results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results</a>
      are based on a particular run from his laptop. The absolute numbers are less important
than the insights gained from them.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>Not surprisingly, regular expressions beat out every other solution. More interestingly, carefully
hand-crafted solutions tended to not only perform worse, but were also harder to read. The result
should not come as much of a surprise. The regular expressions were able to make one transition from
Perl down to highly-optimized internal code to make the match. Most of the other solutions required
several Perl-level operations to complete and the overhead of those ops shows.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, on this particular mix of strings, the normal advice to use <em>non-greedy</em> matches
for speed did not really have much of an effect.</p>
      <p>We had 8 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        cPanel, Inc. for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
