    <p>Paul Archer gave an interesting talk that covered the modules
    <code>Image::IPTCInfo</code>, <code>Getopt::Long</code>, and
    <code>Text::Query</code>. He described these modules in the context of
    his program <code>iptckeyword</code>.</p>
    
    <p>Apparently, there are (at least) two standards for addig metadata to
    images. The EXIF format is great for storing information about the event of
    taking a picture (time and date, etc.) but not really good at containing
    metadata about the subject. The IPTC format was created back in the '70s for
    keeping up with the information that the news services needed to keep with
    pictures (including subject, photographer, copyright, and keywords).</p>

    <p>The <code>iptckeyword</code> program supports manipulating the keyword
    portion of the metadata stored with the images. The program also supports
    searching groups of images based on these keywords.</p>
    
    <p>Paul showed how <code>Getopt::Long</code> was used to handle command line
    parameters to control the program. He also showed the use of
    <code>Test::Query</code> to allow the use of boolean expressions to search
    the keywords in the images. The <code>Image::IPTCInfo</code> module is used
    to actually manipulate the IPTC information in the images.</p>
    
    <p>The example code will be added to the site in a few days.</p>

    <p>As an added bonus, Paul talked about setting up a MythTV system and
    <em>volunteered</em> to answer questions on the subject, if you would like
    to set one up for yourself.</p>
    
    <h2>Update</h2>
    
    <p>Here are the files from Paul's talk. I'm also including his description
    below.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/downloads/iptckeyword">iptckeyword</a> program</li>
      <li><a href="/downloads/iptcsynonyms.conf">iptcsynonyms.conf</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A little background: IPTC is (among other things) a standard for
    embedding information into digital image files. Unlike EXIF, IPTC is
    primarily intended for user-supplied data. (EXIF is almost all
    camera/scanner generated data.)</p>
    
    <p>One of the most useful parts of IPTC (for me, anyway) is the ability to
    give each file multiple keywords, and then be able to search by those
    keywords. That's what I wrote iptckeyword to do.</p>
    
    <p>I despaired of writing a good (decent, or even usable) parser for
    searching, so I asked the Perl Beginner Mailing List, and Randal pointed me
    towards Text::Query::ParseAdvanced. It took a bit of fiddling to get
    working, but the code to utilize it is actually only a few lines long, and
    it does a great job. The only (minor) caveats are 1) you need to quote your
    search string so the shell sees it as a single argument, and 2) it produces
    two warnings about prototypes if you use the 'perl -w' construct on the
    shebang line.</p>

    <p>Play with it a bit, and it'll be pretty obvious how it works. There are
    a couple of hints in the POD ('perldoc iptckeyword'), too.</p>
    
    <p>Find a jpeg or two (say foo.jpg and bar.jpg).</p>
    <ul class="bare">
      <li>Add a couple of keywords:
        <ul class="bare">
          <li>./iptckeyword --add 'cat,dog, lemur' foo.jpg bar.jpg</li>
          <li>./iptckeyword --add 'monkey, zoo' foo.jpg bar.jpg</li>
	</ul></li>
      <li>Then you can do a couple of searches:
        <ul class="bare">
          <li>./iptckeyword --match 'lemur or monkey' *jpg</li>
          <li>./iptckeyword --match 'cat or dog' *jpg</li>
	</ul></li>
    </ul>
