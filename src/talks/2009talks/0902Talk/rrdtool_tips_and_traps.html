<div class="slide">
<h1>What is RRDtool?</h1>
<p>RRDtool manages one or more <em>round robin databases</em> of time
series data.</p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is a Round Robin Database?</h1>
<img src="images/rrd.png" width="200" height="200" style="float:right;"/>

<p>A fixed size ring of data positions makes up the database.</p>

<div class="handout">

<p>A round robin database is a systems for storing a fixed number of data points
covering a sliding window of time. The database does not grow over time. All
of the data positions are allocated initially. When we've used all the available
positions, old data is overwritten rather than new space being allocated.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is Time Series Data?</h1>

<p>Every piece of data is associated with a point in time.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>RRDtool does not store data like a relational database. Every number
    in the database is associated with a particular point in time. The
    data has no meaning except in relation to this time.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Use Case: Tracking Router Data</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">Began as <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/">MRTG</a> (Multi Router
Traffic Grapher) </p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>Tobias Oetiker and Dave Rand originally wrote MRTG to generate graphs
    of traffic flowing through network routers. The database portion of this
    project is now RRDtool.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Use Case: Munin</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/munin.png" height="80" width="305" alt="Munin logo"/>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/">Munin</a> is a monitoring tool
for computer performance</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>Munin tracks and graphs performance of multiple computers. It can
    track and graph:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>network performance</li>
        <li>CPU load, memory usage</li>
        <li>hard drive statistics</li>
        <li>DNS</li>
        <li>Jabber connections</li>
        <li>Email stats</li>
        <li>HTTP connections</li>
        <li>LDAP activity</li>
        <li>OpenVPN conections</li>
        <li>database connections</li>
        <li>and more</li>
    </ul>

<div class="slide">
<h1>RRDtool Tips</h1>

<p>Tips can be partitioned into three areas</p>

<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Graphs</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">

    <p>Although the concept seems pretty straight-forward, there are several things
    that you need to think about the make the best use of RRDtool. These follow pretty
    directly from the design, but may not be immediately obvious.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Time Tip: Input at Regular Times</h1>

<p>Input at regular times gives more consistent results.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>Because of the way that RRDtool stores data, the most consistent behavior
    results from entering data at regular intervals on the time step. If you
    are a little off time, the program interpolates the data from the time you
    entered to the step time.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Time Tip: Timescales and Resolutions</h1>

<p>Choose your resolution based on the timescales you might want to display.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>The higher the resolution, the more space you will need to store the
    data.  It is hard to use high-resolution, long-term data. For example, how
    likely are you to want to graph data from two years ago to a resolution of
    5 minutes?  High resolution is useful for recent data, lower resolutions
    are good for longer term data.</p>

    <p>RRDtool explicitly supports the ability to keep multiple timescales in
    the same file. Choose the resolution for each timescale to be reasonable.
    for that scale. RRDtool handles consolidating the data for the different
    resolutions.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Tip: Consolidation Functions</h1>

<p>Consolidation functions determine how the data is converted to other
timescales.</p>

<ul>
    <li>AVERAGE</li>
    <li>MIN</li>
    <li>MAX</li>
    <li>LAST</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">

    <p>The consolidation function associated with each round robin archive in
    the database determines what data is stored. Each consolidation function
    summarizes the data in some way to reduce what is actually stored. This
    involves a loss of information. Choosing the right consolidation function
    can help preserve the features of the data that you are interested in.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Tip: Data Source Types</h1>

<p>The Data Source Type determines how RRDtool interprets incoming data.</p>
<ul>
<li>GAUGE</li>
<li>COUNTER</li>
<li>DERIVE</li>
<li>ABSOLUTE</li>
<li>COMPUTE</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">

    <p>GAUGE is as close as you can get to storing individual data points.
    It's designed for tracking things like temperatures.</p>

    <p>COUNTER is for continuously incrementing counters. The counter never
    decreases, except for counter resets.</p>

    <p>DERIVE stores the derivative of the data.</p>

    <p>ABSOLUTE is for a counter that is reset on each read. Used for fast
    counters that we want to have the largest potential change on each read.</p>

    <p>COMPUTE is for storing the result of a formula applied to the other
    data type.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Tip: Multiple Pieces of Data</h1>

<p>A single RRD can contain multiple pieces of data, provided they are all
updated at the same time.</p>

<div class="handout">
    <p>There are often circumstances where you are tracking multiple pieces
    of information at once. If you can collect them together and update the
    RRDtool at the same. This simplifies comparing related data.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Graph Tip: Transform Data as You Graph</h1>

<p>Use <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph_data.en.html#ICDEF">CDEF
statements</a> and <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph_rpn.en.html">RPN</a>
to convert the data before graphing.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>When specifying a graph, you can use CDEF statements to convert data
    before graphing. The CDEF statement uses an RPN-based transformation
    language to do the conversions.</p>

    <p>Using this mechanism, you can graph data with some default value in
    place of any unknown, or scale the graph by some amount. You can combine
    multiple data sets to get the graph you need or any of a number of other
    effects.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Graph Tip: Special Effects with CDEF</h1>

<p>CDEF can be used to change the way data is
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/gallery/index.en.html">displayed</a>.</p>
<div class="handout">

    <p>CDEF statements can be used not only for recalculating data.
    They can also be used to generate interesting graph effects. Some
    of the graphs on the attache page a pretty straight-forward. Others
    are generated by transforming and overlapping the datasets in various
    ways.</p>

    <p>Many of the effects are the results of shifting data up or down.
    Multiplying by -1 generates a reflection of the data.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>RRDtool Traps</h1>
<p>Traps can be partitioned into three areas</p>
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Graphs</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">

    <p>One problem with RRDtool is that it does not actually act the way most
    people tend to expect. It's functionality is completely reasonable within
    the bounds of what it was designed to do: track time series rates in
    multiple time scales.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, if you expect to be able to retrieve exactly the data
    you put in, you will be surprised. Many of the problems that people
    encounter are misunderstandings around this issue.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Time Trap: Data not at Step Time</h1>

<p>Data entered off the step time is transformed to fit the step.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>In order to track data in a finite space, all incoming data must be
    transformed to fit the time steps that are expected to be stored. In
    addition, the data is treated as a rate to track, so certain assumptions
    can be made about how the data is transformed.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Time Trap: Heartbeat vs. Step Size</h1>

<p>The <em>heartbeat</em> determines how many undefined values are tolerated.</p>
<p>The <em>step size</em> specifies how often data samples are saved.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>If you don't have a value for a particular time stamp, RRDtool can
    deal with it three ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the value to zero (RRDtool never does this)</li>
        <li>Set the value to <code>UNDEFINED</code>. (RRDtool does this if
          we are missing <code>heartbeat</code> number of entries.</li>
        <li>Generate an average value based on the other entries in the
          RRD. (RRDtool does this if we have few than <code>heartbeat</code>
          missing entries.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Only one data item is stored per <code>step</code> seconds. It doesn't
    matter how many extra data points are entered.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Time Trap: Step Size vs. Entry Time</h1>

<p>The times at which the data are stored is determined by the step size.</p>

<img src="images/day_test.png" width="581" height="279"/>

<div class="handout">

    <p>I know this seems obvious, but there is an implication that usually
    trips people up when the start storing data at lower resolutions. The
    entry time for each data point can be determined by epoch times that
    are even multiples of the step size.</p>

    <p>Most people are not to bothered by the fact that you can't take five
    minute samples starting at 2 minutes after the hour. For resolutions up
    through hourly, this definition works quite well.</p>

    <p>However, at a step size of 1 day (86400 seconds), you might be
    surprised to find that the day doesn't start where you thought it did.
    As far as RRDtool is concerned the day starts at 00:00 hours UTC. If
    you are in Houston, that means days are shifted 6 hours from where you
    thought they were. This is really visible on a graph.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Trap: It's Always a Rate</h1>

<p>All data is treated as time-series rates.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>This is an artifact of the original use of RRDtool. Every data point
    is associated with a point of time. All data is stored as a rate of
    change of data. This has some interesting implications relating to
    transforming the data you provided into the data RRDtool stores.</p>

    <p>RRDtool only stores data at specific time steps, if you enter data
    at a different time step. The program transforms the data into
    <em>equivalent</em> data for the actual timestamp it stores. The
    definition of equivalent is based on the fact that the data represents
    a rate. As long as the rate is preserved, the transformed value is
    considered equivalent.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Trap: Cannot <em>Fill in</em> Old Data</h1>

<p>RRDtool only allows data entries after the last data point entered.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>There is no way to go back and correct an old data point. There is
    no way to go back and fill in a data point you missed at an earlier
    time. This is not the same as a traditional relatioal database, each
    time entry is done once.</p>

    <p>This can really be a problem if you have multiple data points in the
    database and one of those doesn't have data. There's no way to fill that
    data point later.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Trap: Unknown Values</h1>

<p>Unknown data values may have effects you aren't expecting.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="images/hb_test.png">Heartbeat Example 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="images/hb_test2.png">Heartbeat Example 2</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">

    <p>As described above, it's important to remember that missing data points
    either show up as <code>UNDEFINED</code> or get averaged away depending
    on the heartbeat value and the number of undefined values.</p>

    <p>This is a feature of the system, not a bug.</p>

    <p>Undefined values are not graphed. You can use a CDEF statement to
    transform them into another value, but undefined values do not get graphed
    otherwise. They are ot automatically converted to zero.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Data Trap: Wrong Data Source Type</h1>

<p>Different data types are appropriate for different data.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="images/dst_test.png">Data Source Example</a></li>
    <li><a href="images/dst_test2.png">Data Source Example <F2></a></li>
</div>

<div class="handout">

    <p>Choose the data source type wisely to get the best result. GAUGE is
    the only data source type that approximates normal data. The others are
    variations on the idea of a counter for streaming data. The reason for
    this dates back to the original usage for tracking router data.</p>

    <p>Choosing each of the other types depends on whether or not you are
    sampling a counter, getting a new chunk of data, or tracking a value
    that rises and falls, not just rises.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Graph Trap: Changes in Resolution</h1>

<p>The farther back in time you look, the less resolution is needed.</p>
<div class="handout">

    <p>One of the interesting features of RRDtool databases is the ability
    to store the same data at different resolutions for different timescales.
    RRDtool handles populating all of the timescales once you set it up
    correctly.</p>

    <p>For example, you might want to store recent data to a resolution of
    five minutes so that you can query the data for today and yesterday at
    high resolution. You may want to look at hourly data for each of the last
    6 months. For the last 12 months, a daily resolution may be enough.</p>

    <p>There is no need to store 5 minute samples from 3 years ago. Odds are
    that no one is really going to care about the data transfer rate between
    10:05 am and 10:10 am on February 7, 2005.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Graph Trap: Pixel Size Determines Resolution</h1>

<p>The amount of data in one pixel-width of time determines the resolution.</p>

<div class="handout">

    <p>If the resolution would result in a time-step smaller than a pixel, it
    is not used. It is possible to override ths decision, but RRDtool defaults
    to the smallest resolution that produces a time step at least one pixel
    wide.</p>
