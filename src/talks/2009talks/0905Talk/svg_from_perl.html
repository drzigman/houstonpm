<h1>What is <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>Vector</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>SVG is a format for vector graphics. In raster graphics, the image is
    made of a large number of colored dots. Vector graphics, on the other hand,
    are made up of a series of graphic objects.</p>

    <p>In a raster graphic, a blue circle is a bunch of blue dots that happen
    to be contiguous and roughly circle shaped. In a vector graphic, a blue
    circle consists of a circle object with a specific position, radius, and
    a color of blue.</p>

    <p>One side effect of this approach is that vector graphics are effectively
    infinitely scalable.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>?</h1>
<p>W3C Recommendation since 2001</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Although you may have only heard of SVG recently, it's actually been around
    for a long while. Several viewers have been in place for many years. We're
    currently on our 3rd revision of the standard (1.0, 1.1, and 1.2). The result
    is a relatively mature specification.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>?</h1>
<p>XML-based vector graphics format</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>As an XML-based format, SVG is extensible. It is not a binary format that
    is difficult to extend. SVG supports foreign namespaces. This allows you to
    embed non-graphic information that is easily parsed out of the file. (We'll
    have an example of this later.</p>

    <p>This also means that creating SVG is something that you can do by hand,
    with an XML editing tool, or through code.</p>

    <p>Most of all, SVG is a graphics format.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>?</h1>
<p>Support for declarative animation</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>SVG imports parts of the <acronym title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</acronym>
    specification relating to animation. This allows you to specify in XML animation
    effects including movement and transformation of objects, changing attributes,
    and some user interaction.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What is <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>?</h1>
<p>Support for scripting</p>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>SVG supports the ECMAscript scripting language for programmable interaction.
    With scripting, you can interact with the DOM of the document, react to user
    events, make calls to external servers, etc. This feature supports building
    small applications in SVG.</p>

    <p>Here in mid-2009, scripting seems to be implemented more widely than SMIL
    in the web space. I have the impression that it's the reverse in mobile devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> isn't?</h1>
<p>A new programming language</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>SVG is not a replacement for all of the programming work you are doing on
    a given project.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> isn't?</h1>
<p>A complete replacement for Flash</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Many people remain focused on the idea of SVG as a <em>Flash killer</em>.
    And, to be honest, there are some areas where Flash and SVG can both be
    used. However, their approaches are quite different. So there are undoubtedly
    places where one is more effective than the other.</p>

    <p>I don't know enough about Flash to give a good explanation of where it
    would be most effective.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> isn't?</h1>
<p>A magic solution to all web image woes</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Some people seem to want to use SVG to replace all images on their site.
    But, SVG is not a replacement for everything. PNG and JPEG still have their
    place. SVG is actually lousy for encoding photographs or photo-realistic
    images. These kinds of images are much more efficiently stored in raster
    formats.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> isn't?</h1>
<p>A <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> design tool</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>I often see the complaint that SVG will never amount to anything because
    it doesn't have menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and other GUI controls.
    Strangely, the same people don't claim that JPEG is dead for these same
    reasons.</p>

    <p>SVG was intended, from the beginning, to be a technology that would work
    well with other XML-based specifications. There has been quite a bit of
    experimentation with using SVG and HTML together. The W3C is also currently
    working on better interaction between HTML and other forms of markup for
    HTML 5.</p>

    <p>That said, SVG is well-suited to building graphic elements for GUIs. It is
    used relatively extensively in KDE. It is also supported by Opera widgets.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>What <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> isn't?</h1>
<p>Completely <a href="http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php">supported</a> everywhere</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This is the biggest problem at the moment. SVG support is growing in all
    of the major browsers except one. There are a few plugins that add support to
    IE, with more on the way.</p>

    <p>More importantly, browser support is increasing at a rapid pace. Three or
    four years ago, browser support was almost non-existent. Now large portions
    of the specification are supported by Firefox, Opera, Safari/Webkit, and Chrome.</p>

    <p>It's my understanding that one of the biggest applications for SVG support
    has been mobile phones, mostly in Asia. We are seeing a small amount of that
    uptake trickling over to the west.</p>

    <p>SVG has been used quite a bit for clipart and icon development (KDE). But,

<div class="handout">
    <p>The cartography community has really embreaced SVG. They can not only generate

    almost anyone else.</p>

<h1>Why Should I Care?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Easy to manipulate from code</li>
<li>Powerful client-side features</li>
<li>Increasing number of implementations</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This is the part of SVG that really grabbed my attention. Building nice-looking
    graphics from code is not generally easy. How many of you can create nice-looking
    JPEGs, given only a JPEG library? How many of you have used
    <code>Image::Magick</code>? How easy is it?</p>

    <p>About the only graphics most of us generate are relatively straight-forward
    line and bar graphs. Maybe a pie chart, here and there. For those, we would
    probably rely on a library that does the heavy lifting for us. It's not that
    general graphics are impossible to do from code. But, most formats are optimized
    for storage space and display speed, not ease of programming.</p>

    <p>You'll probably notice one browser conspicuously missing from this list.
    Although MS keeps saying they are looking into SVG, they don't seem to have
    made any progress with this <em>open web standard</em>. Of course, they have
    continued on their own <em>proprietary technologies</em>.</p>

    <p>In fact, Tim Berners-Lee called them out on it in an MSNBC

<div class="handout">
    <p>Adobe released <acronym title="Adobe SVG Viewer">ASV</acronym> shortly
    after the first SVG specification was released. Around the same time-frame,
    Corel also introduced a plugin as well. Although not perfect, ASV was good
    enough that no one found a need to build a new one.</p>

    <p>When Adobe and Macromedia merged, ASV became a bit of an orphan. Adobe
    has pledged to keep it available, but it is officially unsupported. Given the
    fact that Microsoft has not provided SVG support in IE, several other groups
    have stepped up to try to get an IE-compatible plugin for SVG display.</p>

<h1>Generating <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> in Perl</h1>
<p>Since SVG is XML (basically text), you can generate SVG any way you can generate XML.</p>
<pre><code>
    &lt;rect x="10" y="10" height="50" width="100"
             fill="green" stroke="none" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<iframe height="70" width="120" src="images/green_rect.svg"></iframe>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Of course, to be XML it must be well-formed; and to be SVG, it must be
    valid. But other than that, there are a number of ways to generate it.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>The <code>print</code> Method</h1>
<pre><code>
    print qq{&lt;rect x="10" y="10" height="50" width="100"},
          qq{ fill="green" stroke="none" /&gt;\n};
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
    <p>It's relatively easy, and requires no extra libraries. However, there's
    no support for making sure you are building well-formed SVG. There's no
    help for attribute and element names. There's no help for getting the
    namespaces correct.</p>

    <p>You are basically on your own.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>The <code>XML::LibXML</code> Method</h1>
<pre><code>
    my $rect = $doc-&gt;createElementNS( $svgns, 'rect' );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'x', 10 );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'y', 10 );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'height', 50 );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'width', 100 );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'fill', 'green' );
    $rect-&gt;setAttribute( 'stroke', 'none' );
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Much more verbose than the <code>print</code> approach. But, output is
    guaranteed to be well-formed. There are no guarantees about valid SVG,
    but at least the output is XML.</p>

    <p>The verbosity issue can be handled with higher level subroutines.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>The <code>SVG</code> Method</h1>
<pre><code>
    $svg-&gt;rect(
        x=&gt;10, y=&gt;10, height=&gt;50, width=&gt;100,
        fill=&gt;'green', stroke=&gt;'none'
    );
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Much less verbose than the <code>XML::LibXML</code> approach. Slightly
    more verbose than the <code>print</code> approach. More protection against
    invalid elements. No protection against invalid attributes.</p>

    <p>Namespace declarations are taken care of so you don't have to.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>The Template Toolkit Method</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">In template</p>
<pre><code>
  &lt;rect x="[%x%]" y="[%y%]" height="[%height%]" width="[%width%]"

  );

<div class="handout">
    <p>This approach is very useful if much of the SVG you need to output is
    boilerplate with a small amount that needs to change. Templates are a good
    way to separate the presentation part from the output you really need to
    create.</p>

    <p>Thanks to its XML nature, every SVG file contains some boilerplate information.
    In addition, many SVG images contain a number of elements used for background
    imagery or supporting graphics. This boilerplate and static content can be placed
    in the template and does not need to be generated.</p>

<h1>Separation of Concerns</h1>
<p>Use a drawing package (like <a target="_blank" href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>) to build
the background portions of the <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>
and add to it with Perl.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>An SVG application often consist of a small amount of boilerplate text,
    some background graphics, and some graphics that are generated by the code.
    The background stuff doesn't have to be static, it could be animated or
    support script-based interaction. The key part is that it does not need to
    change from one run of the program to the next.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, if the whole SVG application is generated with code,
    this boilerplate and background stuff needs to be written as well. But, some
    stuff is much easier to generate with a drawing program instead of with
    code. If the background portion can be read in and the result modified
    by code, you get the best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>A template-based approach works particularly well with this idea.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Separation of Concerns: Animation</h1>
<p class="dos"><strong>Do:</strong> Rely on <acronym title="Synchonized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</acronym>
and scripting to animate on the client side.</p>
<p class="dos"><strong>Don't:</strong> Try to animate from the Perl side</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>If you aren't used to the scripting or animation capabilities of SVG,
    you might be tempted to Use a lot of request/response code to call to a
    Perl program to decide what to do next. This would not be the best
    approach.</p>

    <p>For maximum responsiveness, you want to do work on the client side
    whenever possible. With SVG's scripting ability, you can do a surprising
    amount in the application. The games from the examples before give you a
    beginning idea of what is possible. If your viewer has SMIL support, you
    can get some animation and interactivity without any scripting at all.</p>

<h1>Separation of Concerns: DOM Manipulation</h1>
<p class="dos"><strong>Do:</strong> Use scripting to manipulate the

    <p>If you need calculations or data that would be too much for the script
    to handle, you might want to make an asynchronous call to a server to
    retrieve just the data. Then, use scripting to manipulate the interface
    using the returned data.</p>

    <p>Just like the whole <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</acronym>
    thing, you don't need to send a whole new SVG file for an update. Maybe you
    can get away with sending the data that you can use to make the appropriate

    <p>One thing that works extremely well is to take a trick from some
    compiled languages. In the Perl code, you can pre-calculate information
    that you output into the script as tables. This pre-calculation approach
    can result in the script being capable of more because the heavy lifting
    has already been done.</p>

    <p>The key to good Perl/SVG applications is to use the each language in
    a way that plays to that language's strengths.</p>

written for my son.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This started as a simple application that took output from the <code>Games::Maze</code>
    module and generated better looking graphs. From there, it evolved different styles and
    sizes for more challenges. The interactive side came last as I realized that not much
    was needed to make them actually playable.</p>

    <p>This was a quick-and-dirty implementation using the <code>print</code> method.
    It's main positive attribute is that it works.</p>

using Template Toolkit from profiling data on different viewers.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This application was part of a profiling project I did for measuring the
    speed of scripting implementations across several viewers.</p>

    <p>It was also the first time I had tried using Template Toolkit for generating

<p>This is a work in progress.</p>

    One of these days, I need to get around to finishing it.</p>

<h1>Example: SVG::Sparkline</h1>
<p>Perl module for creating sparklines.</p>
<p>The Perl code can support substantial
<a target="_blank" href="http://anomaly.org/wade/projects/svgSparklines/">configuration</a>
and build a small SVG file.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Because there can never be too many graph modules on CPAN, I wrote the
    SVG::Sparkline module. SVG makes sparklines easier than in most graphing
    libraries because of the scaling issue. However, general-purpose graphing
    libraries are too general to fit the intent of sparklines.</p>

    <p>This library was also a mechanism for me to explore the SVG Perl module.</p>

<h1>SVG in Other Languages: Java</h1>

<div class="handout">
    <p>Batik is probably the most mature of the language libraries out there.
    It supports both generation and rendering of SVG. Current versions support
    much of the specification, with the nightly builds pushing the support
    even further.</p>
