<h1>Exception Handling in Perl</h1>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Error Handling Strategies</h1>
<p>How do we respond to errors in a program?</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>One of the major differences between a quick hack and production code
    is the manner in which the code handles errors. There are several
    strategies for dealing with errors.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Ignoring Errors</h1>
<p>Assume everything goes down the <em>happy path</em>.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This approach is used by quick-and-dirty scripts and one-liners. You
    probably shouldn't use this approach in any code that is used more than
    once.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the <em>happy path</em> is not guaranteed. It can be
    interrupted by almost anything from a bad environment to malicious users
    to bad programming.</p>

    <p>We'll ignore this approach.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Error Returns</h1>
<p>Return special values to signal when code failed to act correctly.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This is the approach most people are familiar with. If a function is
    successful, it returns one kind of value. Otherwise, it returns some kind
    of error indicator.</p>

    <p>Since this is the most common approach to error handling, we'll use it
    as a standard to which we'll compare exceptions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Global Variables</h1>
<p>Signal an error by updating a global variable.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>We've all seen this with <code>errno</code> (or <code>$!</code>).</p>

    <p>The global variables for error codes have a couple of really
    serious problems. The first is that they are global, and can therefore
    be changed by code other than what we are currently checking.</p>

    <p>Most global variable-based error handling is also hampered by the
    fact that no one wants to stomp on an error that's already there. If
    a function succeeds, it usually doesn't reset the global. This means that
    if you have an error code, you don't know how long it's been an error.</p>

    <p>We won't be looking at this approach further.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Signals</h1>
<p>Asynchronous signalling from the OS or hardware.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Requires a special handling routine to recover. Not useful in general,
    but needs to be listed for completeness.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Abort or Exit</h1>
<p>In case of error, stop the program.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>Not particularly robust. But, on the positive side, you know there
have been no errors before any piece of code that gets executed.</p>

<p>Sometimes used when continuing would be more harmful than crashing. This
approach (or actually restarting) is pretty common in embedded programs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<p>An exception is kind of like a <em>non-local return</em> with information
attached.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>We'll have a lot more to say about these.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h1>Exceptions in Perl</h1>
<ul>
    <li><code>die</code>/<code>eval</code></li>
    <li>Exception</li>
    <li>Exception::Class</li>
    <li>Other modules we'll discuss later.</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Of course, there is more than one way to do Exceptions in Perl. But,
    all forms start with the basic <code>die</code>/<code>eval</code> pair.</p>
    
    <p>You've probably used <code>die</code> before to display a message to
    <code>STDERR</code> before exiting the program. Exiting the program is the
    normal behavior for an <em>uncaught exception</em>. Perl provides a way
    to catch the result of a <code>die</code> with a block <code>eval</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>Exception</code> module converts the string passed to
    <code>die</code> into an exception object. The module also provides syntactic
    sugar to make exceptions in Perl look more like exceptions in other
    languages.</p>

    <p>The <code>Exception::Class</code> module provides an approach to easily
    declaring exception objects.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why use Exceptions?</h1>
<p>Exceptions separate error handling logic from the normal logic of the
code.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Done correctly, an exception handling strategy consolidates error
    checking and recovery into well-defined points in the code. Instead of
    handling errors where they occur (when you may not have enough information
    to handle it properly), exceptions are passed to a higher level where
    better recovery is possible.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Anatomy of Exception Code</h1>
<ul>
    <li><code>try</code> block</li>
    <li>Exception handlers: <code>catch</code> block</li>
    <li>Default exception handler: <em>catch all</em> block</li>
    <li>Code to <code>throw</code> exception</li>
    <li>Possibly a <code>finally</code> block</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This list uses more standard terms to describe exception handling. This
    terminology is more specific than the keywords we use in Perl.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Simple Exception Example (C++)</h1>
<pre><code>
    try {
        fragile();
    }
    catch( IOException &amp;ex )
    {
        // recover from IOException
    }
    catch( SQLException &amp;ex )
    {
        // recover from SQLException
    }
    catch( ... )
    {
        // recover from all others
    }
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
    <p>I used C++ for this example because it follows the syntax many people
    will be more familiar with. C++ and Java are very close in this respect.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>try</code> block specifies the code where we expect exceptions
    to occur. (Shown here by the function named <code>fragile()</code>.
    Following the <code>try</code> block are a series of <code>catch</code>
    clauses that each handle a kind of exception. Inside that block you can
    do whatever recovery you deem reasonable and either drop out of the block
    or <em>re-throw</em> the exception.</p>

    <p>The final <em>catch anything</em> case is not required. So that we may
    defer the handling of other exceptions to a higher lever routine.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Perl Equivalent</h1>
<pre><code>
    eval { fragile(); };
    if(ref $@ and my $ex = $@) {
        if($ex-&gt;isa('Exception::IO'))
        {
            # recover from Exception::IO
        }
        elsif($ex-&gt;isa('Exception::SQL'))
        {
            # recover from Exception::SQL
        }
        else
        {
            # recover from all others
        }
    }
<div class="handout">
    <p>The Perl equivalent is similar in structure, but is missing the specialized
    keywords and syntax. Several modules on <acronym title="Comprehensive Perl
    Archive Network">CPAN</acronym>, provide syntactic structures to make this
    system look more like people from other languages might expect.</p>

    <p>The most unfortunate thing about the Perl syntax is the reliance on the
    <code>$@</code> global variable. If you are not careful, you can easily
    run code that changes this variable, losing the exception. That's why it
    is very important to save the value of <code>$@</code> to another variable
    as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception Advantages</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Can't accidentally ignore them</li>
    <li>Simpler code paths</li>
    <li>Multiple error returns are easy</li>
    <li>Handle errors at a different level than detected</li>
    <li>Unhanded exceptions stop the program</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Fans of exceptions point out that they have lots of advantages.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception Disadvantages</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Extra code to ignore them</li>
    <li>Exception path is (sort of) hidden</li>
    <li>Care is needed to make code <em>exception safe</em></li>
    <li>Unhanded exceptions stop the program</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>The critics of exception handling point out that exceptions have many
    disadvantages.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Perl Exception Disadvantages</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Odd syntax: <code>die</code>/<code>eval</code></li>
    <li>Throwing strings vs. objects</li>
    <li>The <code>$@</code> variable</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Perl's exception handling mechanism is somewhat different than that in
    most languages. People with experience with exception handling in other
    languages sometimes look down on Perl's approach because it's different.</p>

    <p>Using <code>die</code> to throw exceptions, Perl makes the simple <em>exit
        on error</em> strategy compatible with exceptions. If you don't try to
    catch an exception with an <code>eval</code> block, the <code>die</code>
    exits the program.</p>

    <p>To support the use of <code>die</code> to display a message and exit,
    it can use a simple string instead of some special exception object. Many
    people use regular expressions to look at the thrown string to determine
    the type of exception. Since <code>die</code> takes </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Error Return Advantages</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Easy to understand</li>
    <li>Control flow is visible</li>
    <li>Easy to ignore errors you don't care about</li>
    <li>Unhandled errors do not stop the program</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Probably the most common approach to error handling is error returns.
    Each function defines what it returns in the case of an error and each
    calling function tests and handles any errors.</p>

    <p>Since the error handling is explicit at each call and return, tracing
    the control flow in the case of errors should be mostly straight-forward.
    Moreover, if the error is non-fatal, you can just ignore the return value
    and continue. If any error condition is not handled, the program is not
    aborted early, unlike exception.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Error Return Disadvantages</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Error handling flow obscures program flow</li>
    <li>Easy to ignore errors you don't know about</li>
    <li>Unhandled errors are invisible</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Despite it's ease of use, the error return approach does have
    disadvantages. The most obvious problem comes from the explicit nature
    of the error recovery. A program that does a thorough job of recovering
    from errors can be almost completely swamped in error recovery code.</p>

    <p>The less obvious, but more dangerous, problem is the fact that errors
    can easily be accidentally missed. There is no way to tell the difference
    between errors you meant to ignore and ones you accidentally ignored.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception Safety</h1>
<p>How does the code respond to exceptions?</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>One complaint that many people make about exceptions is that you
    have to be very careful because you never know what can throw an
    exception.</p>

    <p>For several years, people have tried different strategies for writing
    exception-safe code. Most of the approaches that people developed were
    somewhat ad-hoc, until David Abrahams described the levels of exception
    safety.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Abrahams Guarantees</h1>
<ol>
    <li>No guarantee</li>
    <li>Basic guarantee</li>
    <li>Strong guarantee</li>
    <li>No-throw guarantee</li>
</ol>
<div class="handout">
    <p>These levels do not tell you how to deal with exceptions, they just
    provide a way to reason about them.</p>

    <p>The first level is not usually on the list, but it is a case you need
    to consider.</p>

    <p>The Basic guarantee covers two issues, no resource leaks and all
    invariants remain. No exception should leave the code in an unstable or
    illegal state.</p>

    <p>The strong guarantee means that the action either completes successfully
    or the state of the program is the same as if the code had never executed.
    This is sometimes called a transactional or atomic guarantee.</p>

    <p>The strongest guarantee is the <em>no-throw</em> guarantee which promises
    that no exceptions are thrown and the code completes successfully.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Practical Exception Handling</h1>
<p>Theory is great, but how do exceptions perform in reality?</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Without some actual code, it's quite hard to see the trade-offs you
    need to consider when using exceptions. Most importantly, the difference
    between exceptions and error returns are much smaller for a small piece
    of code.</p>

    <p>In a 20-line program, it really doesn't matter how you deal with errors.
    As the code gets larger and more complex, exceptions help to deal with the
    complexity of error handling.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>An Example</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Complicated enough to show trade-offs</li>
    <li>Simple enough to be easily understood</li>
    <li>Short enough that I'm willing to write it multiple times</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>One problem with trying to demonstrate the usefulness of exceptions is
    that it becomes more apparent in larger programs. This is a lot like
    demonstrating objects. Object oriented code and exceptions both seem like
    mostly overhead in a 20 line program.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we're not going to want to build a 200K line system
    two different ways to see the difference. The example that follows is
    the minimum I could come up with that would begin to show the advantages
    of exceptions. I hope you can imagine how these differences would expand
    as a program increases in size.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Example Code without Exceptions</h1>
    <p>This is <a target="_new" href="examples/return_codes.pl.html">a mock
    program without exceptions</a>.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>This is a pointer to some code that has been written without exceptions.
    It's not real code, but it follows patterns you may have seen.</p>

<p>This is <a target="_new" href="examples/return_codes_full.pl.html">the same
program with all errors actually checked</a>.</p>
<div class="handout">

</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>autodie</h1>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if Perl builtins threw exceptions?</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>The <code>autodie</code> module turns functions that use error returns
    into functions that use exceptions. Once you get used to using exceptions,
    this can be extremely handy.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Example with <code>autodie</code></h1>
<p>This is <a target="_new" href="examples/autodie.pl.html">the same
program with <code>autodie</code> exceptions</a>.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Let's revisit our code sample with <code>autodie</code> enabled.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Observations</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced error propagation code</li>
    <li>Potentially better error coverage</li>
    <li>Error paths are harder to see</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>From the examples, we can see some of the trade-offs that are involved
    in using exceptions. We can see that progation of errors happens pretty
    much automatically, which can reduce the lines of code in intermediate
    functions.</p>

    <p>Depending on the code, it is possible to get better coverage because
    the low-level code can always throw exceptions, knowing that higher-level
    code will do the right thing. This means that you are less likely to miss
    a critical mistake because you didn't check for it.</p>

    <p>However, the error paths are harder to see, because they may happen
    mostly implicitly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception Hierarchies</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The one, true hierarchy</li>
    <li>Lots of small hierarchies</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>When exception objects are used rather than strings, there is an ongoing
    debate about whether the exceptions should be in one large hierarchy or 
    multiple smaller hierarchies.</p>

    <p>The main argument for the one-big hierachy is the <em>catch
        everything</em> case. Where you want to be able to catch all exceptions
    with a single base class.</p>

    <p>Like most approaches that attempt to stuff everything into one large
    hierachical structure, this tends to fall down when you end up forcing
    very different kinds of exceptions into a parent-child relationship.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Other Exception Modules</h1>
<ul>
    <li><code>Exception::Class::TCF</code></li>
    <li><code>Class::Throwable</code></li>
    <li><code>Exception::Class::TryCatch</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
    <p>There are various modules out there that add syntactic sugar to make
    Perl exception handling look more like other languages. Each has its own
    trade-offs.</p>

    <p>There are also a number of modules that simplify the creation of
    exception object.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception Advice</h1>
<p>There are good and bad ways to use exceptions.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Like any new technique, people often go overboard when they actually
    <em>get it</em>. Here are a few <em>Do</em>s and <em>Don't</em>s to keep
    in mind when using exceptions (in any language).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Don't use exceptions for the normal path.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Exceptions are meant to be used for exceptional or error conditions.
    They should not be triggered in the normal functioning of the code. You
    don't need to avoid exceptions, but use them as a tool for the purpose
    they were designed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Don't catch exceptions and rethrow them at every level.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Almost every new user of exceptions comes up with the idea of catching
    the all exceptions in each function (usually to add a little stack info)
    and rethrow the exception. This results in a large amount of useless
    monkey-motion that doesn't actually help matters much.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Don't catch and ignore exceptions (mostly).</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Catching an exception and ignoring it should be a relatively rare
    circumstance. By doing that, you are ignoring a potential problem in the
    code and hiding that from higher-level routines that might actually be
    able to handle it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Rarely use <em>catch all</em> handlers except at outermost level
or propagating.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Catch-all handlers are also easy to misuse. Except at the outer-most
    level of your code (where it serves to catch anything that may have been
    missed elsewhere). The best use of the catch-all handler for Perl is to
    propagate any exceptions you didn't handle to higher levels.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Don't use exceptions in the place of simple conditionals.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>If a method answers a simple question with a boolean, don't replace
    it with an exception in the false case.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Don't</em></h1>
<p>Don't use exceptions instead of other flow control.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>If the code calls for an <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>-type
    construct, use them rather than overload exceptions for that purpose.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Do</em></h1>
<p>Use exceptions to deal with errors and unexpected conditions.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Exceptions can do a very good job of consolidating error handling and
    recovery. Using them for their intended purpose can make your code more
    maintainable.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Do</em></h1>
<p>Throw (<code>die</code>) at low-level, as soon as the error is detected.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Often the point where you can detect a problem is where you have the
    least context for dealing with the problem. Don't try to recover from
    errors low in the code. Throw an exception and let someone else react
    appropriately for this circumstance.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Do</em></h1>
<p>Catch (<code>eval</code>) only when you can handle an error.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>There's no since in catching an exception, if you can't do anything
    about it. Allow the exception to propagate to a level with the appropriate
    context to recover from it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Do</em></h1>
<p>Partially handle an exception with catch and re-throw idiom.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Sometimes you can't completely deal with an exception, but you can
    perform some cleanup that would be inconvenient at a higher level. In this
    case, it is perfectly reasonable to do some recovery and then rethrow the
    exception for another level to finish the recovery.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Exception <em>Do</em></h1>
<p>Catch-all at outer-most level of the code is a good idea.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>No matter how careful you have been, eventually an exception is thrown

    changes to a library, or just something you missed. A catch everything case

<p>Converting exceptions at module boundaries can be a good idea.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>In many cases, it is a good idea to catch exceptions at the boundaries
    of (third-party) modules and convert them into exceptions that your code
    is able to deal with. This is especially important if the exceptions from
    the module are very low-level. Logging the exception and converting it into
    a more generic exception may simplify later code.</p>

    <p>By using lexical variables and class <code>DESTROY</code> methods, as
    appropriate, Perl cleans up resources for you automatically in the presence
    of exceptions.</p>
