      <h1 class="heading">Beginner Resources</h1>
      <p>Before the meeting actually kicked off, we had a short discussion on resources
      for beginning Perl programmers. The suggested resources included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a></li>
        <li>Yahoo Group: perl-beginner</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="heading">Arrays and Hashes</h1>
      <p>We also had a quick overview of some features of Perl hashes
      and lists. We discussed Perl's features for converting one into
      the other.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This month we continued Paul Archer's exploration of the <a
    href="http://www.delcom-eng.com/">Delcom Engineering</a> <a
    href="http://www.delcom-eng.com/products_USBLMP.asp">USB Visual Signal
    Indicator</a>. Paul is using the <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/">libusb</a>
    library and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Inline-0.44/C/C.pod">Inline::C </a>
    to interface with this hardware device.</p>

    <p>Last time, we had managed to get the VSI device to turn on and off the
    individual colors and combinations of colors. In the time since the last meeting,
    Paul had worked out the code to manipulate the intensity of the LEDs. He was
    having trouble configuring the switch to work. This was where we began.</p>

    <p>Paul had the documentation for the VSI device that describes all of the
    control messages that must be sent to make the device work. Unfortunately, he
    was already aware that the document was not always correct. One of the parameters
    was different in the sample code that we started with. Changing this value to the
    one in the documentation would not control the device.</p>

    <p>Paul had coded the two commands needed to configure the button support. The
    button supports two programmable features. One feature generates a confirmation
    tone each time the button is pushed. The other feature turns off the speak and
    all LEDs when the button is pushed. These features can be set independently,
    giving a total of four modes of operation.</p>

    <p>Upon careful reading of the documentation, we discovered a discrepency between
    in the paragraph describing the configuration parameters. Although the document
    said you could turn both features on with the MSB=0x03, it refered to the bits
    of interest as bit 6 for <em>Auto Clear</em> and bit 7 for <em>Auto Confirm</em>.
    When we tried the high bits instead of the low bits, we were able to change modes.
    During the experimentation, we learned that setting the bits in the most significant
    byte (MSB) enabled the features. Reseting the bits in the MSB had no effect.
    Rereading the documentation revealed that setting the bits in the least significant
    byte disabled the feature.</p>

    <p>We modified the subroutine to be much more Perl-friendly and were able to
    change button modes, more or less at will.</p>

    <p>Since the meeting, Paul has expanded the features available in the program to
    support flashing a color, controlling the speed of flashing, and configuring the
    buzzer. The prototype code appears to be working quite well. The current prototype
    is listed below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="led-usb.pl">led-usb.pl</a>: latest prototype</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once again, Paul did a great job of leading the presentation. The device
    is somewhat interesting and the audience participation was good.</p>
