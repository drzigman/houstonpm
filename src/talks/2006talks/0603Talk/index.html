    <p>For the March meeting, Paul Archer lead a further session on the
      LibUSB/Delcom VSI project. During this presentation, we experimented
      with controlling two of the Delcom devices on one computer. None of the
      current prototyping code supports multiple devices with the same vendor
      and product id, so Paul solved the problem by</p>

    <ol>
      <li>plugging in one device</li>
      <li>programming it to flash all three colors</li>
      <li>plugging in the other device</li>
      <li>programming it to flash all three colors</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We were also able to get the serial numbers from the two devices
      to verify show that we were looking at two different devices. There
      was some talk of changes to the libraries to allow us to talk to
      two devices at a time without plugging them in separately.</p>

    <p>Paul explained the use of the <code>Inline::init</code> function for
      allow us to keep the C code in the <code>__DATA__</code> section while
      still building a module. (It's in the <code>Inline::C</code> cookbook
      documentation, I just didn't read far enough.)</p>

    <p>We also decided that this project had passed beyond the point where
      it makes an interesting presentation. There is still quite a bit of
      cleanup and some more functionality to implement. But none of that
      makes for an interesting presentation. Maybe we can have another quick
      wrapup when the project is complete.</p>
      
    <p>Any further information about the project will be added to the project
      page: <a href="/projects/delcom_vsi/index.html">Delcom VSI/LibUSB
      Project</a>.</p>
