    <p>Paul Archer began the night with a solid introduction to the
      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> version control
      system. In addition to the main project site, he showed two other
      references to information on Subversion:
      </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)">Subversion (software) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a starting point, he created a repository using the command:</p>

    <pre><code>
       svnadmin create /path/to/repos
    </code></pre>

    <p>This command creates a Subversion repository by setting up an
      appropriate directory tree and repository storage. The repository
      is accessed using the <code>svn</code> command using a URL. For local
      access, you can use a <code>file:///path/to/repos</code> or after
      setting up the appropriate server you can use <code>svn:</code>,
      <code>svn+ssh:</code>, or <code>http:</code> URLs.</p>

    <p>The main portion of the presentation followed the tutorial in
      the book <cite>Version Control with Subversion</cite> referenced above.
      In addition, Paul covered some of the benefits of version control for
      an individual developer.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the ability to back out changes that don't work<li>
      <li>more confidence in making changes, because you can back out</li>
      <li>ability to compare previous versions to explore how the code has
        changed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also briefly discussed when to commit changes. There are several
      models used by different groups. All of which work under different
      circumstances. Which one you choose depends mostly on what makes you
      (or your company) most comfortable. In order from informal to formal:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>After any complete change</li>
      <li>Before large or potentially dangerous changes</li>
      <li>Any time the code is compilable and runnable</li>
      <li>Only after the code successfully completes a test suite</li>
      <li>After code completes the test suite and full code review</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also discussed the concepts of <em>tagging</em> and
      <em>branching</em>. A tag is normally applied to mark a set of files
      as a point in time we might want to recreate. For example, most groups
      tag the code for a release, because we will want to be able to rebuild
      that code at some time in the future. A branch, on the other hand, is
      used to perform development separate from the main line of development
      (the <em>trunk</em>). Unlike most other systems, Subversion implements
      tags and branches in exactly the same way, using <em>cheap
      copies</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">Caching</h2>
    <p>After covering the basics of Subversion, Paul turned his attention
      to chapter 3 of the book <cite>Higher Order Perl</cite>. This chapter
      covers the concept of <em>caching</em>, which is a standard technique
      for speeding up <em>pure functions</em>. Pure functions are defined
      as functions whose output depends only on their inputs. Caching can
      also be used on functions that depend on something other than their
      inputs (like a database) provided the function should always return
      the same output for a given set of inputs.</p>

    <p>Paul went on to talk about the <code>Memoize</code> module that
      simplifies adding caching to a Perl function. He showed how to add
      caching to a function with the addition of two lines of code.</p>

    <pre><code>
      use Memoize;
      memoize 'func';
    </code></pre>

    <p>He finished by talking about how the ability to easily add caching
      changes the way you think about optimizing code.</p>
