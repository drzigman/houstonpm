    <p>Glenn Pringle provided an introduction to building PDF files in Perl.
      He focused on the <code>PDF::API2</code> module. Although this module
      is pretty low-level and does not supply a lot of <em>helper</em> methods
      to simplify building a PDF, it did supply everything needed to solve
      Glenn's problem on a project.</p>

    <p>Glenn demonstrated a CGI script that was used to request a car for
      use by employees of a government agency. One of the important aspects
      of the problem was a printable receipt generated for each request.
      Using PDFs for the receipt provided an official looking printout that
      solved the customer's requirements.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, due to the low-level nature of the module, Glenn found
      himself spending a fair amount of time on issues such as aligning text
      and handling word-wrap manually. Despite the extra work, the module
      did handle everything that he needed and he was able to complete the
      project successfully.</p>

    <p>Glenn, then, went on to show how he used <code>HTML::Template</code>
      to make the CGI script easier to maintain by separating the HTML into
      a template and keeping the code in the Perl script. Comments from the
      audience provided further insight. Although it does not support all
      of the bells and whistles of some of the bigger templating solutions.
      <code>HTML::Template</code> apparently is simple to get working
      quickly and can handle many tasks needed for a set of web pages.</p>
