    <p>For the May meeting, Wade Johnson lead the conclusion of the two-part
      discussion entitled <em>What Every Perl Programmer Should Know: tips,
      tricks, and common knowledge</em>. The idea from the presentation came
      from a book for another language I read called <cite>C++ Common
      Knowledge</cite>. That book got started a chain of thought about what we
      as Perl programmers should all know.</p>

    <p>Like the previous meeting, we kept more to a discussion format than
      a pure presentation. We continued using the <a
      href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> used last time to store
      and organize the material used in the presentation. Just like in April,
      we extended the document based on the discussions triggered by comments
      and questions from the audience. There was enough additional information
      generated this time around, that the document needed some serious
      reorganization.</p>

    <p>The resulting presentation is available on the <a
      href="../0604Talk/tiddlywiki_weppsk.html">attached page</a>. Instead
      of having two version of the document online, the document from last
      month has been extended with the new information.</p>

    <p>As the session wound down, we ended up discussing two topics that don't
      really fall into the common knowledge theme: debugging and version
      control.</p>

    <p>The debugging question concerned alternatives to <code>print</code>
      statements for debugging CGI scripts. The ability to run
      <code>CGI.pm</code>-based CGI scripts from the command line was discussed
      slightly. We also talked about using the built-in Perl debugger and the
      <code>Devel::ptkdb</code> module that provides a gui front-end to the
      debugger.</p>

    <p>The question of version control came up, with some people commenting that
      they tend to just make backup copies for small projects. Wade recommended
      looking seriously at <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
      for any level of development.</p>
