      <h2 class="subhead">Lightning Talks</h2>
      <p>Instead of having one large presentation this month, we decided to have
several people give shorter presentations.</p>

      <h3><abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> Done Correctly - Robert Stone</h3>
      <p>Robert made the assertion that <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> is a very good approach to writing
software and suggested that people who don't like <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> aren't doing it
properly. He walked through an example of some code he wanted to
develop, showing how to use <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> from the beginning.</p>
    <img src="person.png" alt="UML class diagram of Person class and Exercise Role" width="588" height="171" />
    <p>Starting with the UML diagram above, Robert wanted to show <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> in the best
light. In the interest of time, he showed the begining of the development real-time and finished
with some of the code and the tests that he had developed along side.</p>
      <p>The audience ended up asking a lot of questions around the periphery of
his main topic. There were questions about the use of <code>make_immutable</code>,
some of the vim features he used, as well as the trade-offs of using
<code>cmp_ok</code> versus <code>is</code> from <code>Test::More</code>.</p>
      <p>Robert also showed an interesting technique for creating a test class
using <code>Moose::Meta::Class</code>, with an attached role in order
to test the role in isolation.</p>
      <p>The code for the talk is available as a <a href="tdd.tar.gz" target="_blank">tarball</a>
for download.</p>

      <h3>Radix Sort - Julian Brown</h3>
      <p>Julian presented some research that he had been doing on a sort that
was claimed to be even faster that the standard Perl sort. The inventor
describes it as a kind of general purpose radix or counting sort. This
generated quite a bit of discussion about radix sorts and this algorithm
in particular. (<a href="201701_keynote.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a>)</p>

      <h3>Sessions - Jocelyn Kirby</h3>
      <p>Jocelyn described some of the history of maintaining session information
for a web application, starting from the early days with only cookies
and progressing to the present with modern session object techniques using
Dancer. (Slides: <a href="Sessions.gslides" target="_blank">Google Slides format</a>,

      <h3><code>vim</code> tips - G. Wade Johnson</h3>
      <p>Wade followed up some with a set of vim tips to expand on what Robert had
mentioned. He showed a one line command that provides a way to load a
beginning template when creating a new file based on the extension:
<pre><code>
    autocmd BufNewFile * silent!    0r ~/.vim/templates/%:e.template
</code></pre>
He said he doesn't remember where he saw it, but it is quite effective
for filling in initial boilerplate for new files. He also showed uses of the
block seletion, and text objects that are useful for intermediate level vim editing and 
talked about a couple of plugins.</p>

      <h3>Some of My Modules - Michael R. Davis</h3>
      <p>Michael showed his list of his CPAN modules (ID: <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MRDVT"
      target="_blank">MRDVT</a>). The modules
he highlighted ran the gamut from modules that provided a single function
to a plugin-based library for GoogleEarth.</p>
      <p>We had 7 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        cPanel, Inc. for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
