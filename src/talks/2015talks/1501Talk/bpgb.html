<h1>Best Practices Gone Bad</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>G. Wade Johnson</h3>
<h4>Campbell Johnson</h4>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What Are Best Practices?</h1>
<p><q>Commercial or professional procedures that are accepted or prescribed as
        being correct or most effective.</q></p>
<p>Practices agreed on by a given community.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Best practices serve as a kind of mental shorthand to avoid having to
        rethink how to do everything each time. This also helps less senior
        people do mostly the right thing, even if they don't understand why.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>How Can Best Practices Go Bad?</h1>
<p>They don't.</p>
<p>People misuse these practices.</p>
<div class="handout">
    <p>Best practices do not cover all of the reality of a particular process
        They mostly work as a reminder if you already know what you are doing.
        They also serve as a good starting point for those who are completely
        lost.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Do People Misapply Best Practices?</h1>
<p>This is easier to explain after some examples.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>Honestly, you wouldn't believe me if I told you now.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>A Tale of Two Lengths</h1>
<p>The goal is to have readable, maintainable code.</p>
<p>Define coding standards to enforce consistency.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>This is an example from a place I worked years ago. They had a very rigid
    set of coding standards/coding style. I was not able to get a decent
    explanation of most of the rules during the short time I was there.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Practices</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Expressive (long) names</li>
    <li>80 character line length</li>
    <li>Java/method chaining</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The first two points were specified in the company standards. There were no
    provisions for violating the rules under any circumstances. The final is a
    common coding practice in the Java community. Since the code was written in
    Java, it was not surprising that we saw it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Results of Tale</h1>
<pre><code>
    SpecialResultClass resultOfInterestingAction
        = businessObjectCollection.getItemByIndex(
            theIndexOfTheObjectOfInterest
          ).performActionReturningInternalObject()
           .performInterestingAction();
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
<p>Obviously, the names have been changed to protect the guilty. This is
    actually pretty close to some of the code I saw while working there.</p>
<p>Take a moment to see if you can tell what is actually happening.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Clearer, Less-Cluttered Approach</h1>
<pre><code>
    Result result = businessObjs.get( i ).getFoo().act();
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
<p>Except for a little license for too generic names, this is much easier to
    understand. Even if the variable and method names are shorter, it is
    still as clear as the original (if not more so). And, as a bonus, it
    doesn't take up 20-25% of a screen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
<p>The two best practices were pushing in opposite directions.</p>
<p>These results clashed especially with language common practice.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>This is a case of two best practices chosen with reasonable thought
    individually, but with no thought to how they would interact. To make
    matters worse, when it was obvious the rules were conflicting they just
    got more stubborn about enforcing the rule.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Unnecessarily <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr></h1>
<h2>The <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> Principle</h2>
<br />
<blockquote>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
    authoritative representation within a system.</blockquote>
<p class="right"><cite>Pragmatic Programmer</cite>, Hunt and Thomas</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>I originally saw this as the <em>One Right Place</em> principle from P. J.
    Plauger's book <cite>Programming on Purpose</cite>. Each piece of knowledge
    in a system should be be represented in only one place. And this place
    should be the obvious, or right place for that information.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What most people hear</h1>
<p class="center">Remove duplication.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>Despite a very clear explanation of what the authors meant by <abbr
    title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>, what most people hear is don't
    duplicate your code.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Overly <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> Constants</h1>
<pre><code>
   constant FOUR =&gt; 4;

   $hour = DECEMBER;

   my @months = ('') x DECEMBER;
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
<p>In the first case, we probably had a series of uses of the literal <code>4</code>
    with no obvious relation. So, the programmer gave a very generic (and
    therefore, useless) name for the constant. In one system I maintained a long
    time ago. The constant <code>FOUR</code> had actually been given the value
    <code>5</code> at some point.</p>
<p>In the other two cases, we have a constant for the month of December and the
    code uses it inappropriately. What's worse, depending on how the value is
    used, it's obvious value could be either <code>11</code> or <code>12</code>
    and we have no idea which.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Overly <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> Code</h1>
<pre><code>
   sub process_items {
       my ($which, @items) = @_;
       foreach my $item (@items) {
           if( $which == 0 ) { $item = ''; }
           elsif( $which == 1 ) { $item .= reverse $item; }
           elsif( $which == 2 ) { $item *= 2; }
           else { $item *= $item; }
       }
       return @items;
   }
</code></pre>
<div class="handout">
<p>In this case, someone noticed a bunch of loops that processed an array. To
    avoid having the loop in multiple places, they decided to copy them all to
    this one routine and provide a control variable to tell which thing to do.
    The first clue that this is a bad idea is the name of the function. It does
    mostly say what the routine does, but it doesn't tell you anything. Also,
    we will be doing one or more comparisons on the variable for each item of the
    loop. That's obviously an unnecessary waste of time.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
<p>The focus is on code/text duplication rather than knowledge duplication.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>In most cases of <abbr>DRY</abbr> failure, the problem was focusing on the
    actual text that is duplicated and not on the knowledge. In both the
    constant and code cases, it's pretty obvious that focusing on the meaning
    rather than the code would have made us realize that even though the text
    is the same, there is no duplication.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Good solutions to repeated problems</li>
    <li>Good names for recognizable solutions</li>
    <li>A new way of formulating and describing solutions</li>
    <li>Good design practice</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The <cite>Design Patterns</cite> book by the <em>Gang of Four</em> came out
    in 1995. The book made a rather sizable impression on people doing <abbr
        title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> at the time. Most people
    realized that this was an important piece of work. But not everyone agreed
    why. Interestingly, the Java programming language was taking off about the
    same time, and Design Patterns became very much tied up in what many Java
    programmers saw as the right way to write code.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Pattern Mania</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li><q>Your design is bad, because it doesn't contain <em>real</em> patterns.</q></li>
    <li>hello_world: 17 patterns</li>
    <li>Java has multiple levels of decorator for its <code>InputStream</code>s</li>
    <li><q>I had a problem, so I used Java. Now I have a <code>ProblemFactory</code>.</q></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The first comment usually comes from people who have never programmed in a
    time without Design Patterns. It sometimes also comes from people who had a
    religious conversion upon reading the book.</p>
<p>The second item is a joke based on a problem you see from junior programmers
    that first find patterns. After all, they reason, if one pattern is good
    using all of them must be better.</p>
<p>Although the Decorator approach to I/O that Java uses is quite elegant and
    allows a fair amount of flexibility without too many classes, they do not
    give a shortcut for the most common use of file input. This requires that
    you always have to create a <code>FileInputStream</code> and wrap it in a
    <code>BufferedInputStream</code>. Therefore, people who aren't aware of
    this are always stuck with unbuffered output.</p>
<p>The final is a joke about some Java programmers who use designs as the default
    way to solve any problem. It's not really a comment on the language. It's
    more about how it's often used.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why did it fail?</h1>
<p>Instead of using Design Patterns descriptively or as an aid to think about
    a problem. They are spread on the problem like a condiment.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>If you really read the Gang of Four book, you can see that each pattern has
    not only suggestions on how it should be used, but also consequences of
    using the pattern. Most of the pattern zealots don't notice there is any
    downside. As with any form of abstraction, the code is somewhat harder to
    understand with a pattern in place. Unless the pattern really provides
    enough benefit, a simpler, less powerful solution may be better.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>How to Do Design</h1>
<p>Any reasonable sized programming problem requires some design.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>This one is a little less clear than the others, because there is not one
    clear best practice for design. It's actually a complicated enough topic
    that people may easily disagree. Let's start off with a couple of
    approaches that most would agree don't work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Code and Fix</h1>
<p><q>You guys start coding and I'll go find out what they want us to build.</q></p>
<div class="handout">
<p>Many inexperienced programmers start solving problems with code before they
    have the slightest idea where they are going. The result is usually an
    unmaintainable, big ball of mud.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Big Design Up Front</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Waterfall approach</li>
    <li>Designing when you know the least you will ever know</li>
    <li>Design is usually compromised as soon as coding begins</li>
    <li><abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr></li>
    <li>Analysis Paralysis</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>To fix the problem with programmers coding without a plan, some decided that
    we should lay out the whole plan ahead of time so we know where we are going
    and when we will get there.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Excessive Flexibility</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Requires predicting the future</li>
    <li>Predicting the future is hard</li>
    <li>Design for change that may not happen</li>
    <li>You probably will miss changes that actually do happen</li>
    <li>Even reasonable assumptions can fail</li>
    <li>SOAP is so flexible most people avoid it</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>In trying to deal with the fact that things would change, many decided that
    we could design flexibility into the system. Portions of the design would
    be easy to change to prepare for things we guessed wrong or changes in the
    requirements.</p>
<p>This can work reasonably well if you are building a project just like ones
    you've built in the past. One might wonder why you just don't use one of
    them.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Push-back Against Big Design: <abbr title="You Aren't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr></h1>
<blockquote>Always implement things when you <strong>actually</strong> need
    them, never when you just <strong>foresee</strong> that you need
    them.</blockquote>
<div class="handout">
<p>After dealing with too many <em>flexible</em> systems that were unmaintainable
    because the requirements never flexed where the code did, there was push-back
    to try to get back to simpler design again.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What is <abbr title="You Aren't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr>?</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>From Extreme Programming</li>
    <li>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work</li>
    <li>Avoid maintenance of code that is not yet needed</li>
    <li>Avoid bugs in code that is not yet needed</li>
    <li>You know less now than you will when you really need it</li>
    <li>This would only work if it costs more later to implement</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Done correctly, this should reduce the <em>code bloat</em> and <em>feature
    creep</em> associated with trying to design for every eventuality.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1><abbr title="You Aren't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr> Overload</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Avoid coding something that is actually a requirement</li>
    <li>Avoid thinking about a complex design to see if we need it</li>
    <li>Leave out <em>convenience</em> functions</li>
    <li><a href="http://xkcd.com/221/" target="_blank">Maybe a little too simple</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Of course, there's no principle in existence that can't be taken to extremes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Did These Fail?</h1>
<p>Too much up front design fails because we can't predict the future.</p>
<p>Too much <abbr title="You Aren't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr> looks like
    <em>head in the sand</em> code and fix</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>Not surprisingly, the reality is a need to think when you are doing design.
    We need to think about what might be in the future, but code for the
    present. Resist the urge to code for things that might happen, but actually
    build anything that is required.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Do People Misapply Best Practices?</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
    <li>Cargo Culting</li>
    <li>Misunderstanding</li>
    <li>Lack of Experience</li>
    <li>Lazy/fuzzy thinking</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>Unfortunately, two of the things that best practices should help us with are
    the same things that cause the best practices to fail.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inexperience</li>
    <li>Lack of time/inclination to think deeply about the problem</li>
</ul>
