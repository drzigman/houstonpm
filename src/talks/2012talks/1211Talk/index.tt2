      <p>Wade lead a discussion of small scripts or code snippets that people use to
make their lives easier.</p>
      <p>A few others described or demonstrated some of their favorite tricks. Since
the discussion was pretty much off-the-cuff, there were no slides to post.</p>
      <p>We had 5 people attending this month. As always, we'd like to thank
        cPanel, Inc. for providing the meeting space and food for the group.</p>
