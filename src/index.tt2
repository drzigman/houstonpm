    <p>This is the branch of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a>
    meeting in Houston, Texas. Perl Mongers is a loose association of
    international Perl User Groups. We discuss and educate people on the Perl
    programming language, as well as projects and modules written in Perl.</p>

    <p>We meet on the second Thursday of each month. The meeting officially
      starts at 7pm and runs until around 9pm. Meetings are open to the public.
      We don't have any dues, <em>official</em> membership, or anything like
      that. If you are interested in Perl, you are welcome to come.</p>

    <p>For technical meetings, we meet in the lobby of
      <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3131+W.+Alabama,+Houston,+TX&hl=en&z=17">3131 W. Alabama St.</a>,
      starting sometime between 6:30pm and 7pm. Once everyone arrives, we
      head upstairs to a conference room for the meeting.</p>

    <p>We also have social meetings at some nearby restaurant or pub in some
      months if there is no topic for a technical meeting.</p>

    <p>Check the <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a> link for details.</p>

    <p>Our meeting attendance has always been highly variable. Recently,
     there have been 10-20 people at the meetings.</p>
