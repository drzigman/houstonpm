    <h2 class="subhead">Monthly Meetings</h2>

    <p>We meet the second Tuesday of each month. July 2009 marked our first
    <a href="remote_meetings.html">remote meeting</a>. As we work out the
    glitches, we hope to have more of these.</p>

    <p>Houston.pm meetings have split into technical meetings and social
      meetings. The technical meetings have been at
      <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=&vps=1&jsv=196c&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=47.349227,96.152344&ie=UTF8&geocode=FT7ExQEd2fBP-g&split=0">3131 W. Alabama St.</a>.
      We meet in the lobby between 6pm and 6:20pm. When everyone
      has arrived we go to the conference room. Parking is free on the
      street after 6pm.</p>

    <p>Our most recent social meetings have been at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=3929+Southwest+Fwy,+Houston,+TX">Fuddrucker's on the Southwest
          Fwy</a> near Weslayan.
      Our social meetings usually involve some technical discussion.</p>

    <p>Houston.pm is also on Meetup.com as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Perl-Meetup/">Houston Perl Meetup</a>.
    We're using this site to help bring more people to Houston.pm. We have
    also been running the meetings with DimDim for remote access to the
    technical meetings.</p>

    <p>In the past, our meetings have consisted of a presentation, with plenty
      of audience participation. Before and after the presentation, we discuss
      various topics that are at least vaguely related to Perl. We have also
      had presentations on projects that various members were working on.</p>

    <p>People are encouraged to bring problems they are working on to the
      meetings. If you need a fresh set of eyes on a Perl problem, there
      are probably a few people at each meeting who can help.</p>

    <p>We have also had group programming projects. The idea was to spend
      a few months following a programming project by some members of the
      group. Once the project gets past the experiment and prototype phase,
      we stop working on it in the meetings. Some of the resulting code is
      now on CPAN, and more is in development.</p>
