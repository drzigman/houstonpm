    <h2 class="subhead">Monthly Meetings</h2>
    
    <p>We meet the second Tuesday of each month. Previous meetings were held
      at <a href="http://www.hal-pc.org/">HAL PC</a> from 7PM to 9PM. Click
      <a href="http://www.hal-pc.org/map.html">here</a> for directions. Of
      course, HAL PC encourages you to join.</p>

    <p>We are trying a new location and time for November 2006. The meeting will
      be downtown at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1111+fannin+77002&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=19&ll=29.754784,-95.365013&spn=0.001106,0.002682&t=h">1111 Fannin St.</a>
      in basement room A at 6pm (we will probably start around 6:15 to give
      people time to get there.)</p>

    <p>In the past, our meetings have consisted of a presentation, with plenty
      of audience participation. Before and after the presentation, we discuss
      various topics that are at least vaguely related to Perl. We have also
      had presentations on projects that various members were working on.</p>

    <p>Earlier this year, we had a group programming project. The January,
      2006 meeting began a group programming project to control a USB-based
      visual indicator from Perl. When that project got past the experiment
      and prototype phase, we stopped working on it in the meetings. Some of
      the resulting code is now on CPAN, and more is in development.</p>

    <p>Our most recent meetings have been more of a directed discussion style
      rather than the presentations we had done in the past. There seems to be
      some interest in continuing this approach for a while.</p>
