    <h2 class="subhead">Monthly Meetings</h2>

    <p>We meet the second Thursday of each month. Houston.pm meetings have
    split into technical meetings and social meetings. The technical
    meetings have been at
      <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3131+W.+Alabama,+Houston,+TX&hl=en&z=17">3131 W. Alabama St.</a>.
      We meet in the lobby on the first floor above ground between 6:30pm and 7pm. When everyone
      has arrived, we go to the conference room. Parking is free on the
      upper level of the garage.</p>

      <p>Our most recent social meetings have been at <a href="http://blacklabradorpub.com/">The
          Black Labrador</a>.
      Our social meetings usually involve some technical discussion.</p>

    <p>Houston.pm is also on Meetup.com as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Perl-Meetup/">Houston Perl Meetup</a>.
    We're using this site to help bring more people to Houston.pm. We have
    also been running some technical meetings with DimDim for remote access.</p>

    <p>Our technical meetings usually consisted of a presentation, with plenty
      of audience participation. Before and after the presentation, we discuss
      various topics that are at least vaguely related to Perl. We have also
      had presentations on projects that various members were working on.</p>

    <p>People are encouraged to bring problems they are working on to the
      meetings. If you need a fresh set of eyes on a Perl problem, there
      are probably a few people at each meeting who can help.</p>

    <p>We have also had group programming projects. The idea was to spend
      a few months following a programming project by some members of the
      group. Once the project gets past the experiment and prototype phase,
      we stop working on it in the meetings. Some of the resulting code is
      now on CPAN, and more is in development.</p>
