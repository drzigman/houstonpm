    <h2 class="subhead">Monthly Meetings</h2>

    <p>We meet the second Tuesday of each month.</p>

    <p>Houston.pm meetings have split into technical meetings and social
      meetings. The social meetings have been more common of late due to the
      pressure of YAPC::NA tying up everyone's time. The technical meetings
      have been at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1111+fannin+77002&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=19&ll=29.754784,-95.365013&spn=0.001106,0.002682&t=h">1111 Fannin St.</a>
      downtown. The social meetings have been at the Bennigan's on Kirby at 59.</p>

    <p>In the past, our meetings have consisted of a presentation, with plenty
      of audience participation. Before and after the presentation, we discuss
      various topics that are at least vaguely related to Perl. We have also
      had presentations on projects that various members were working on.</p>

    <p>We have also had group programming projects. The idea was to spend
      a few months following a programming project by some members of the
      group. Once the project gets past the experiment and prototype phase,
      we stop working on it in the meetings. Some of the resulting code is
      now on CPAN, and more is in development.</p>

    <p>Our most recent meetings have been more of a directed discussion style
      rather than the presentations we had done in the past. There seems to be
      some interest in continuing this approach for a while.</p>
