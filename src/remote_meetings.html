    <h2 class="subhead">Remote Meetings</h2>

    <p>At the July 2009 monthly meeting, we tried to add remote access to
    the meeting, as requested by a few people on the mailing list.</p>

    <p>We only got the last pieces in place hours before the meeting began.
    Despite the incomplete planning and a few technical glitches, the first
    remote meeting went fairly well.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">The Details</h2>

    <p>Before the meeting, we explored several technologies to see what
    would be possibly with minimal effort and expense. We determined a number
    of requirements for a technical meeting.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Ability for everyone to see the slides/presentation</li>
        <li>Audio for people to hear the presenter</li>
        <li>Mechanism for the remote users to ask questions/make comments</li>
        <li>Support for the major operating systems</li>
        <li>Audio from remote sites (optional)</li>
        <li>Full video of presentation (optional)</li>
        <li>Ability to record the presentation (optional)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We explored a few approaches to screen-sharing and just sharing the
    presentation to deal with the first requirement. Most of the screen-sharing
    technologies ran afoul of issue 4. In the end, we used the Google Docs
    Presentation Tool which allows a presenter to walk everyone through the
    presentation at once (with the caveat that only people logged in to a
    Google account could see the slides advance).</p>

    <p>Based on past experiences, we thought a conference call type setup would
    probably be adequate. We considered 3 approaches: someone conference
    calling from a business phone, Skype (up to 14), and
    <code>freeconference.com</code>.  Skype was our best choice, but it was
    eliminated due to restrictions where we hold the meetings. We ended up
    going with <code>freeconference.com</code>, despite the long distance
    charges involved (and less-than-perfect voice quality).</p>

    <p>Based on previous experiences with long distance meetings, we decided
    that IRC was a useful solution for issue 3. We got the channel
    <code>#houston.pm</code> on <code>irc.perl.org</code>. This allowed side
    conversations and remote questions. We also used it to signal when the
    presenter changed slides for those who were not logged on at Google. One
    thing we did not do, that we should have was capture the chat for inclusion
    in the presentation notes.</p>

    <p>The most contentious issue was number 4. This eliminated Windows-only
    solutions. Also as a kind of worst-case scenario, this month's presenter
    uses Linux, which eliminated some alternate solutions that only support
    as a viewer, not a presenter. Given that the reason for the remote meeting
    was the statement that some people were excluded because they could not
    travel to the meeting location. Excluding people based on their chosen
    platform seemed a bad idea.</p>

    <p>We were able to hear the remote sites through the conference call.
    Unfortunately, the lower voice quality from <code>freeconference.com</code>
    made this much less useful than the IRC.</p>

    <p>We ended up not trying for full video or audio recording of this
    meeting due to lack of time, expertise, and interest.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">Summary of the Meeting</h2>

    <p>As experiments go, this one was a qualified success. People were able
    to join the meeting from remote locations and the remote presentation did
    appear to mostly function. We didn't have as many remote people as I had
    hoped, but I suspect part of that we due to changes in the last 24 hours
    as we tried to get everything together. We also lost the first 20 minutes
    of the meeting to messing around with the technologies involved, but that's
    to be expected with a bunch of technical people.</p>
    
    <p>The audio was not as good as I would have liked and we were occasionally
    interrupted by bursts of static. From previous experience, Skype has much
    better audio quality, especially if everyone other than the presenter stays
    muted (unless asking a question). The long distance call may have also been
    minor factor.</p>

    <p>The main advantage of the Google Docs presentation was the ability to
    have the presenter drive the slides. Since we had some difficulties with
    that, I'm unsure whether it is a better solution than just posting slides
    on a website before the meeting.</p>

    <p>There were some difficulties with people getting to the IRC using
    the <a href="http://irc.rlb3.com/">script</a> that Robert had set up. It
    was a particular problem for people behind a corporate proxy. On the plus
    side, it was really useful for sending URL and such to everyone.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">Future Directions</h2>

    <p>Given the partial success, I think it is worth running this experiment
    again. Hopefully, we can be better organized next time and help people get
    set up appropriately before the meeting begins.</p>

    <p>We need to work out the IRC issues. This technology has been around
    long enough that we should not have needed this much effort.</p>

    <p>We also need to work a little harder on the audio portion of the system.
    Although <code>freeconference.com</code> did work, the audio quality left
    a but to be desired and I wonder if a few people in the general area were
    put off by the need for a long distance call to reach a local meeting.
    Given the IRC functionality, some form of straight streaming audio might
    be a reasonable solution, provided we have a good microphone.</p>
