    <h2 class="subhead">Technical Meetings</h2>

    <p>About once a month, the group lead sends a request for presentations to
      the mailing list. Presentations do not have to be directly about Perl, they
      can be any topic that might be of interest to a Perl programmer. If someone
      volunteers to present, we schedule a technical meeting and announce it in
      all of the places above. If you have a topic you would like to present,
      feel free to email the list or the group lead. You don't have to wait for
      the request for presentations.</p>

    <p>Our technical meetings usually consist of a presentation, with plenty of
      audience participation (but no heckling). Before and after the
      presentation, we discuss various topics that are of interest to Perl
      programmers. We have also had presentations on projects that various members
      were working on. For recent meetings, we've been trying to stream the
      meeting through Google Hangouts.</p>

    <p>People are encouraged to bring problems they are working on to the
      meetings. If you need a fresh set of eyes on a Perl problem, there
      are probably a few people at each meeting who can help.</p>

    <p>We now have two sponsors for our meetings: <a
      href="http://cpanel.net/">cPanel, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">Hostgator</a>.
      We alternate between the two locations for the technical meetings. When
      cPanel is sponsoring, the meeting is at 
      <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3131+W.+Alabama+St,+Houston,+TX&hl=en&z=17">3131 W. Alabama St.</a>.
      We meet in the lobby on the first floor above ground between 6:30pm and 7pm. When everyone
      has arrived, we go to the conference room. Parking is free on the
      upper level of the garage. When Hostgator sponsors, we meet at <a
      href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=HostGator,+Houston&fb=1&gl=us&hq=HostGator,&hnear=0x8640b8b4488d8501:0xca0d02def365053b,Houston,+TX&cid=2141572779937723859&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A">5005 Mitchelldale St #100</a>.</p>

    <p>If there is no topic for a given month, we normally have a <a
      href="social_meetings.html">social meeting</a> instead.</p>
