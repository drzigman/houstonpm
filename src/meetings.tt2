    <p>We meet the second Thursday of each month, starting around 7pm and ending
      around 9pm. Houston.pm meetings have split into <a
      href="technical_meetings.html">technical meetings</a> and
      <a href="social_meetings.html">social meetings</a>.</p>

    <p>The meetings are announced on the Houston.pm mailing list, on the <a
      href="https://plus.google.com/b/104331489743076486517/104331489743076486517/posts">Houston.pm
      Google+</a> page and in our <a href="http://houston.pm.home/atom.xml">Atom
      feed</a>. We try to announce the meetings at least a few weeks in
      advance, but that is not guaranteed.</p>
